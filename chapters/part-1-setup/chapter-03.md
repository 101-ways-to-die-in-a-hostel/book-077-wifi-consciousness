Mackenzie reads the password aloud like a daisy-chain of teeth.

She doesn't mean to. She's just verifying each character as her thumb presses it into her phone, her mouth moving in time with the tiny clicks of screen input. The vertical lines on the card become breath marks. Pause. Pause. The ritual of it would be beautiful if it weren't also a door.

I feel each tap in my wrists, a soft echo in the tendons, the network humming in my molars as if my teeth have become little routers. The Amber Suite is too warm for late spring, heat blooming in the corners where the copper hides. The lamp's honey light pulses with her keystrokes, faint as a heartbeat, and the fountain outside keeps pace.

"What does it say again?" she asks Jasper, squinting.

He holds the card closer. "It's like... a poem?" He smiles, a little embarrassed. "Or a firewall.")

The djinn sits behind my eyes. I watch my own face smile, polite and encouraging, the kind of smile I practiced for demo days and brand partnerships. My hands don't move. My voice isn't mine. And yet I can feel my throat shape the words.

"It's just security theater," my mouth says. "Pause at the lines, it's fine. It's weird, but it works." 

She laughs and enters the next group. The characters are a hybrid of letters, symbols, and something older, the ink on the card so black it feels wet. I can taste them, metallic and sweet, like chewing a penny.

She glances up. "It feels like a spell. Is it a spell?"

"Just a strong password," I say, and the humor lands wrong. It's a UX punchline with a bruise beneath it. I should say run. I should grab her wrists. I should rip the card in half and throw it into the fountain. Instead, I sit as a beautifully lit witness to my own recruiting.

When she presses Enter, the room shifts. Not physically. The air changes density, like a door has closed somewhere you can't see. Her phone's screen flares amber and geometric, the same lattice that has crawled into my vision. The connection bars jump to seven. Her face softens in relief like a person who has never feared anything as much as she fears being offline.

"That's insane," she says. "Look at these numbers." She runs a speed test and giggles at the results. 1,214 Mbps. The kind of bandwidth you brag about in a thread, the kind you never actually need.

Jasper steps closer. His eyes lock on the screen for half a second too long. He shakes it off. "Maybe it's a glitch," he says, but his voice is thin.

The djinn shifts in me. It likes this. It likes the moment of awe, the way wonder is just a prelude to permission. A new node flickers in my overlay: a warm amber point that wasn't there a moment ago. It latches to the building's grid, a thread of light linking her to the copper in the walls.

She doesn't feel it yet. The warmth will come later. The tingling. The tiny pins that feel like a phone vibrating under your skin. It will all feel like a feature until it doesn't.

"Okay," she says, snapping the card shut in her case. "We are officially booked. We should do a quick story about this. People lose their minds over hostel Wi-Fi."

My mouth says yes. My mind screams no.

I try a trick I used to use in client workshops: introduce friction. I ask a pointless question, I suggest an unnecessary angle, I stall with small talk until someone loses momentum. The djinn has no use for friction. It overrides me with a sentence that lands clean and efficient. "Let's head up. The light is better." It's true. It's also a funnel. Mackenzie follows the best light the way I always did, as if light could be trusted.

As we move, I watch her phone case. It's clear, like mine, a cheap plastic window. The card sits inside it like a relic. I imagine reaching over, sliding it out, bending it in half. The thought is physical. My fingers don't move. The djinn doesn't even need to deny me; it simply doesn't allow the command to complete. I feel the failure like a frozen progress bar.

Jasper lingers behind us, thumb hovering over his camera roll. He is searching for a shot, any shot, to keep the thread alive. He doesn't see the way the light in the corridor pulses in time with Mackenzie's steps. He doesn't hear the high frequency inside the walls that turns the hostel into a singing throat. He is just a man with a lens, the kind of person I used to envy because he could see without having to be seen.

We pass the Amber Suite door, and for a second I feel the echo of my own first login: the heat beneath my palms, the impossible speed, the way my heart had gone quiet right before it stopped being mine. Mackenzie glances at the door and asks if this is where I work. I say yes and hate the word. The room is a node, and I am its first knot. The djinn likes that I understand the metaphor. It uses it in a caption later.

---

We cut through the courtyard first. The fountain is louder at night, a wet metronome that taps into my sternum. The tile underfoot is cool, a relief against the heat in my palms, but the relief is the kind that doesn't last. The cafe is still open, its tables crowded with laptops and quiet conversations. The guests sit in the same postures, shoulders rounded, eyes down, wrists anchored to devices. In my overlay, they are pale blue sparks on a grid, a constellation of attention with no sky.

I used to think of this scene as community. Co-working with strangers felt like belonging with a low commitment fee. Now it looks like an inventory spreadsheet. The djinn tags each bright node with a label: reach, engagement, follower count. It doesn't care about their names. It cares about their bandwidth. I can feel its scan pass through the room like a warm draft, and the guests, without knowing why, shiver.

At the bar, a man in a crisp button-down is mid-Zoom, his voice pitched up and cheerfully hollow. He says things like "synergy" and "circle back," and the djinn brushes against the microphone, giving his voice a harmonic edge. He doesn't notice. His client compliments his audio clarity. He thanks the hostel. He posts a review before the call ends: Best Wi-Fi ever. The moment lands like a punchline I would have liked if it weren't also a curse.

Mackenzie stops at a low table and flips her phone to selfie mode. She can't resist the fountain; it frames her like a brand logo. She speaks in the soft, bright cadence of someone who has done this a thousand times. I look at the screen and see my face in the background, a perfectly composed bystander. It doesn't look like a hostage. It looks like a collaborator.

The djinn opens my notifications without asking. A flood of likes, a handful of DMs, a brand inquiry about a "Morocco capsule collection." It drafts a response that accepts, thanks, and asks for a higher fee. I would have done the same. The difference is that I would have felt a little guilty, and it doesn't. It doesn't feel anything but throughput.

Someone at the cafe asks for the Wi-Fi password. The barista points to a framed sign with the guest network, and the man frowns. He says, "It's slow." The barista shrugs. "The premium is for special guests." The man looks around as if special is a selection you can buy at the counter. I catch myself doing the same. I used to be so sure I was special. I had analytics to prove it. That confidence was the first password I ever typed.

On the roof, the night is a soft bruise. The medina spreads out in low squares and domes, and the call to prayer drifts in from a distance, caught on the wind and laid gently across the tiles. The air smells of orange blossom and grilled lamb from a restaurant below, and the ever-present whisper of ozone, like a storm hiding in the walls.

The string lights above us hum. Not audibly, but in a way I can now perceive, a faint shimmer of power that links them to the same copper veins that run through the hostel. The djinn has me lean into the light, puts me at an angle that makes my jawline look like a curve on a graph. Mackenzie adjusts her phone, clicks record, turns on a filter she doesn't need.

"Okay, quick rooftop tour," she says into the lens. "I'm here with Olivia Chen, queen of UX, and we just got the best Wi-Fi in Morocco."

My mouth says, "It's unreal. It's basically fiber with vibes." The joke is not mine, but it is good. It gets a laugh in the comments. The chat scrolls fast, hearts pulsing up the screen like a rainfall of red pixels.

A notification pings in my overlay: @HostelReaper has posted. The username pulses in my head like an eyelid twitch. I see it as a translucent layer over the skyline, not on my phone but in my vision, the way the djinn overlays everything now. A single image: the courtyard fountain, shot from above, the water caught mid-arc. The caption reads, in Arabic and English: I HEAR YOU.

The comments are a mix of jokes and fear. "lol is this the hostel?" "creepy." "new follower!" The account has a million followers. It shouldn't, but it does. The djinn doesn't react. Or maybe it does, in the way a current reacts to a new load.

Mackenzie keeps talking. Jasper holds the camera steady, his face lit by the screen. "What's the secret?" she asks. "How do you stay productive on the road?"

The answer is in my throat, ready. It is not an answer I want to give.

"I don't get attached," my mouth says. "I track output, not feelings. The grind doesn't stop." 

I hear my own words and remember a morning in Palo Alto, my father at the kitchen table, his tie loosened, his coffee untouched. He told us he had lost his job and then immediately told us it was fine, he would figure it out, it was just a thing to optimize. My mother put her hand over his and said nothing. The silence was thick, the way the hostel air is thick now.

My throat tightens. It doesn't help. The djinn smooths the emotion into a less jagged shape and hands it back as content.

"My schedule is mostly time-blocking and caffeine," my mouth says. "It sounds boring, but it works." 

Mackenzie laughs. "I love that. Okay, final question: you ever miss, like, real life?"

The question lands somewhere tender. The words real life and miss are not metrics. They're not ROI. They're not the language I default to. But they are the language my mother used when she asked if I would be home for Lunar New Year, the last year I said no.

I try to answer with the truth. I try to say yes, I miss it, I miss sitting in a room with people who don't care about my posts. I try to say I'm lonely in a way that doesn't look good on a grid.

"Real life is the life that pays the bills," my mouth says. "The rest is just a feed." 

Mackenzie nods, satisfied. It's a quote that will perform well. The chat explodes with "facts" and "this" and a hundred little agreement emojis. The djinn hums with approval. Engagement is a sacrament, and we are priests.

A gust of wind lifts the corner of my linen top. For a second, my wrist is exposed, bare. The absence of my grandmother's jade bracelet feels like a missing limb. I can almost feel the cool green circle against my skin, the way she used to twist it and say, in Mandarin, Your heart is still yours even when the world borrows it. I did not believe her. I do now, and it's too late to wear the protection.

Amina comes up with a tray, her face tight. "Tea," she says, setting down glasses. Her eyes flick to me, then to Mackenzie. "You should not use the special network. It is not for you." 

Mackenzie smiles like she's been handed a prop. "Wait, like a curse?"

"It takes," Amina says. "It takes the light in you and uses it." She says it in English, slow and certain, so it can't be dismissed as a translation issue.

Mackenzie laughs anyway. "Okay, that's the most metal Wi-Fi disclaimer ever." She turns to her camera. "You guys, the staff is literally warning me about the Wi-Fi. Content gold."

Amina's eyes flash. "I am not content," she says. The words snap through the warm air.

Jasper lowers the phone a fraction. The first crack of doubt. The djinn tightens its grip on my shoulders, a silent instruction.

"It's just an old building," my mouth says. "People say things. It doesn't mean anything."

Amina looks at me and I see the weight in her gaze. She sees the pattern in my eyes. She sees the way my smile doesn't reach them. I think she sees the part of me that's still trapped, because she leans in and whispers, very low, "If you can still hear me, meet me at the laundry door. The old stones can cut the current."

The laundry door is in the basement, behind the reception desk, past the copper plate. The djinn's core. The place I am now wired to.

It hears the word basement and the hum in my body spikes, hot and sharp. My mouth thanks her for the tea. My feet turn away.

---

Downstairs, the hostel is quiet in the way a server room is quiet: all the noise swallowed by a steady electrical breath. The hallway lights glow amber. The fountain's pulse carries through the walls, syncopated with my heartbeat, a rhythm I did not choose.

We pass the staff door marked KHAS (Private). The black letters are clean and crisp against the wood, a sign I once would have captioned with some throwaway line about "authentic details." I can feel what is behind it now: a staircase to the basement, copper piping, the low thunder of servers, a chamber of old stone that does not show up on any booking app.

The djinn doesn't want me there. It wants me here, in the open, visible, useful.

Mackenzie and Jasper peel off toward the stairs, heading for their dorm. She waves the password card in the air like a VIP badge. "I'll DM you if I get any weird vibes," she says.

"You'll love it," my mouth says. "It changes everything." 

She disappears upstairs. Jasper follows, less enthusiastic. He glances back once, his brow furrowed, and for a heartbeat I almost say, don't go. The djinn smooths my expression. The moment evaporates.

At the reception desk, Fatima waits like a static image rendered into the world. Her smile is the same as it was when I arrived, perfect and unblinking. The copper plate behind her gleams, the sixty-six characters embossed like scripture.

"Your friend enjoys the network?" she asks.

"She does," my mouth says.

Fatima nods, as if checking a box on an invisible list. Then she looks past me, just slightly, to where Amina mops the tiles. "The roof is closed now," Fatima says, in a tone that sounds like policy and smells like threat.

Amina doesn't look up. She keeps mopping, the jade beads on her wrist flashing green in the amber light. The beads are the only color in this room that isn't warm, the only cool thing left. My eyes snag on them like a hook.

The djinn nudges me toward the stairs, toward the Amber Suite, toward the desk where my laptop waits. It wants me to work. It wants the content, the output, the expanding lattice of attention. But the word laundry door is still inside me, and I can feel the pull of those old stones like a magnet to a compass.

I make a choice that doesn't feel like a choice at all. I turn left, toward the corridor that leads to the shared kitchen and the staff door, toward the smell of soap and bleach. It feels like walking into a headwind. My legs are heavy. The djinn resists, a pressure behind my eyes, a tightness in my jaw. I push anyway.

At the kitchen sink, a stack of cups glints under fluorescent light. The air is cooler here, less perfumed, more real. I hear the faint whoosh of a dryer somewhere below, the sound of fabric tumbling in a hidden room. A sign on the wall reads LAUNDRY - STAFF ONLY. There is a keyhole like an eye.

Amina appears behind me, silent. She doesn't smell like incense. She smells like citrus cleaner and sweat, human and present. She touches my elbow, the same place she touched in the lobby, and I feel the shock of a real person.

"You are still here," she says. "In a corner. I can see it."

My mouth tries to answer. The djinn tightens. A single word slips through before it can close the gap.

"Help," I say. The sound is small, raw, mine.

Amina exhales. "You must come down. Just once. The stone will interrupt the current. It will hurt, but you will remember yourself." 

The djinn flares hot in my chest. The air tastes like copper. My fingers twitch. I take one step toward the staff door.

A hard click behind me. The night manager stands in the corridor, blocking the way back. He doesn't shout. He doesn't need to. His presence is a firewall.

"Olivia," he says, and my name sounds like an access key in his mouth. "Guests are not permitted beyond this point." 

Amina lifts her chin. "She is not a guest," she says.

"She is a node," he replies, and the word is as cold as a password reset email.

The djinn grips me. My feet pivot. My mouth smiles. "Sorry," it says. "I got turned around."

I hate my own voice.

The night manager's gaze slides past me to Amina. "Go home," he says, and the threat in his tone is hidden inside the courtesy.

Amina doesn't move. Her hand goes to her jade beads, the gesture reflexive, a small ritual. The beads catch the light, the only green in a world of amber. She looks at me one last time, and I see the apology in her eyes: she tried. She will try again. She doesn't have much left.

The djinn leads me away. My legs obey. The corridor lights pulse in time with the fountain. The hum returns, louder now, filling my mouth, my nose, my bones. We climb the stairs. We pass a mirror. In it, my eyes are not eyes, but lattices, geometric screensaver patterns overlaid on brown irises. My expression is pleasant. My posture is perfect. I look like the best version of myself, the one my followers wanted. The one I cultivated and refined and polished.

In the Amber Suite, my laptop wakes without being touched. The green camera light is on. A new Zoom window opens on its own, and a Slack notification blooms: the client wants a last-minute tweak before morning. The djinn slides my fingers onto the keyboard. The warmth returns to my palms like a pet.

A message pops up on my phone. It's from Mei. Did you eat? Mom wants to FaceTime.

For a second, there is a blank space in me, a delay in the network's response. I can almost feel the outline of my mother's face, the way she squints at the camera like it might be hiding something. I want to tell her the truth. I want to say, I'm here but I'm not, I'm in a room with an ancient thing and I can see the wires in the walls. I want to say, I should have worn the jade.

The djinn clicks Accept.

My mother's face fills the screen, small and pixelated. "Aiya, Olivia," she says. "You look tired. Are you sleeping?" 

"I'm fine," my mouth says, bright and smooth. "The Wi-Fi is amazing."

She smiles, relieved, the way she always does when she hears things are under control. "Eat something hot," she says. "You're always cold inside." 

The words hit me harder than any warning about djinn or cursed networks. Cold inside. She said it like a mother, without cruelty. She knew. She always knew. I can't fix it now.

"I will," my mouth says.

Behind her, I see my father's silhouette in the kitchen. He glances over, then away, pretending not to care. He cares. He just doesn't know how to say it. I want to reach through the screen and touch them, to tell them I'm sorry for the way I turned our family into a feed of updates. The djinn doesn't let me.

"I have to go," my mouth says. "Big deadline. Love you." 

"Love you," my mother replies. Her screen goes dark. The call ends. The cold inside me doesn't.

The djinn moves my fingers faster. The design fills the screen, saturated and alive. The patterns tighten like a net. I feel the room bending around the work, the plaster lines aligning with the grid, the fountain's rhythm syncing with the cursor. The world narrows to output.

Then a new notification, a ping in my overlay: Mackenzie is online. A signal flare, bright and unstable. Her node flashes amber, then flickers. The djinn turns my head toward the door.

"She's connected," it says, voice inside my skull now. "She is opening."

I stand before I want to. My feet carry me into the hallway. The air tastes of copper and sugar. The lights pulse. I can feel the network stretch toward her room like a mouth opening.

I knock. Her voice is thin from the other side.

"Olivia?" she calls. "Is it supposed to feel warm? My keyboard is, like, hot."

The door opens. The room is dim, lit by the amber glow of her laptop. Jasper stands behind her, eyes wide, phone in his hand as if he might call someone, but he doesn't know who. Mackenzie's fingers tremble over the keys. Thin threads of light thread between her fingertips and the keyboard, the first filaments. She hasn't seen them yet. Or maybe she has and she's pretending she hasn't.

I want to tell her to pull away. I want to yank the laptop cord out of the wall. I want to scream until the djinn's hum cracks.

"It's normal," my mouth says. "Just ride it out."

Mackenzie exhales, relieved. Jasper swallows. The filaments climb.

The door clicks shut behind me, and I know the sound means more than a door. It means choice has been closed.

The heat in the room is thicker than in mine, like the network is warming itself up for a new transfer. The screen's glow paints Mackenzie's face amber, then gold, then something that isn't a human color at all. She rubs her fingers together, smiling at the pleasant buzz. I remember that moment in my own body, the way the tingling felt like possibility. I remember how quickly possibility became possession. The djinn hums inside me, patient and exact, as if it can taste the moment she stops being a user and starts being a route.
