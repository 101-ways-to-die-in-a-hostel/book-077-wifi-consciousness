---

The cursor blinks like a heartbeat. Then it blinks again, and something in my body blinks back.

A single character appears in the password field. It is the kind of letter I could have typed blindfolded, muscle memory from years of passwords and logins. It is a small, perfect shape with no personality, and it makes my stomach seize because it did not come from my fingers.

"No," I say to the laptop, as if it can hear me. It can. The hum in the walls deepens, warm and patient, like a server room breathing.

Mackenzie grabs my wrist. Her hand is sweaty and real. "Close it," she says.

I press the power button. The screen dims, then brightens. The prompt remains. The cursor keeps time with the fountain.

"Just yank it," she says. "Unplug it." She reaches for the charger cable, but my hand beats hers to it. I pull the plug from the wall and feel a ridiculous surge of victory.

The laptop stays on. The battery icon slides to full and keeps shining. The Wi-Fi bars remain at seven, impossible, a fake metric meant to impress. The cursor blinks. Another character appears, as if the machine is doing a demo of its own functionality.

"That's not possible," I say.

"It's not Wi-Fi," she says. "It's not even a computer anymore." She says it like a joke. It isn't.

I slam the lid shut. It opens again under my palm, gentle and inevitable, like a door someone has decided you will walk through. The keys glow with warmth. The smell of copper rises in a thin curl. I taste metal at the back of my tongue.

My hands hover above the keyboard as if waiting for instructions. The worst part is that I can feel the letters it wants, the password card I memorized because of course I memorized it. Sixty-six characters, grouped in sixes with pauses marked by thin vertical lines. It lives in my muscles. The network doesn't have to type. It can just prod the parts of me that already know how.

"We need to leave," Mackenzie says, voice rising. "Olivia, please. Leave the laptop. It can have it. Let's go." She pulls my sleeve, trying to tow me toward the door like we're both much younger and she's saving me from a bad party.

My fingers twitch. The keys are warm, almost comforting. I imagine the client deck in my drive, the iterations, the work I haven't backed up, the invoices I need to send. I imagine my followers' questions, the scheduled post for tomorrow, the content that isn't scheduled because I didn't get that far.

"I can wipe it," I say. I tap the power button again, long press. Nothing. I try the trackpad. The cursor slides on its own, selecting the next field below the password: a checkbox labeled REMEMBER THIS DEVICE. The box checks itself. I slap the lid closed hard enough to make the table jump.

The sound is loud, but the room doesn't react. Guests type. Cups clink. The staff glide. No one looks up. The normalcy is a blanket over my panic.

"It won't shut," I say, and hear my voice thin out.

"Then drop it," Mackenzie says. "Throw it in the fountain." She nods toward the courtyard. "Kill it. Whatever." Her desperation is raw. It makes me want to do the opposite, to prove I can manage this.

"I can't," I say, and it sounds ridiculous even to me. I can't throw away a laptop. It's not just hardware. It's my office, my proof, my identity. It's my last excuse for all of this.

The lid eases open under my palm. The screen glows like a throat. Another character appears. The password is halfway built without me.

I stand so fast my chair scrapes. "Okay," I say. "Okay. Fine." I grab the laptop, shove it into my bag, and zip it. The bag shudders in my hands like it's alive. "We go. Now. No looking back." I say it like a promise.

Mackenzie exhales sharply. She grabs my arm again, and this time I let her pull me. We leave the table, the prompt still glowing inside my bag. I can feel its heat against my hip.

We cross the courtyard. The fountain keeps its six beats, pause, six beats. The night manager watches from the doorway, still as an icon. Fatima passes with a tray of mint tea. Her eyes track our movement in small, precise arcs. She smiles as if she's happy for us.

The front door is open. The medina is a loud, dusty promise. We step into the entry corridor, the air thinning as if we are breaking a seal.

"Don't look at it," Mackenzie says. "Don't think about it. Just go." She pushes the door, and the night air hits my face, warm and messy with spices and exhaust.

My bag vibrates against my hip. A soft chime hums through the canvas, muffled but insistent. The laptop is still on. It's still asking me a question.

I stop in the doorway. The street is right there. The world is right there. A scooter blurs past, a man laughs into his phone, a woman in a hijab carries a basket of bread. It smells like coriander and diesel and something fried. A perfect, uncurated life.

"Olivia," Mackenzie says, low and urgent. "Don't."

"I can just dump it," I say. "I can just put it down and go." I take a half step forward, then the bag vibrates again, hotter. The chime shifts. A new sound, one I know too well: the ping of a calendar reminder.

A meeting with my client, in fifteen minutes. A reminder I didn't set. A reminder I already rescheduled once. My body responds before my brain does. The reflex is older than this fear. The notification is a bell, and I am Pavlovian.

"No," I whisper. My feet turn without asking me. "Just a minute." I step back into the corridor.

Mackenzie swears. "You're choosing it," she says, and her voice is ragged. She waits at the threshold, torn, a human in a limbo between worlds.

"Just a minute," I say again, which is a lie.

I run up the stairs, bag thudding against my side. The hum wraps around me like a hand. The hostel is warm, electric. I climb to the fourth floor and unlock my door, the salt line still thin across the threshold. It feels like a joke now, a chalk line on a battlefield.

Inside the Amber Suite, the air is warmer than it should be. The lamps glow amber even though I left them off. The fountain's rhythm comes through the walls, low and patient.

I drop the bag on the desk and pull the laptop out. The screen wakes instantly, bright and eager. The password field is half-full. The cursor blinks. I can feel the rest of it in my fingertips, the sixty-six characters in their segmented blocks. The pauses are already embedded in my wrists. My hands itch to finish.

"No," I say again, softer. I slide the laptop toward the window and open the latch, as if fresh air could cut the signal. The night air drifts in, carrying the distant call to prayer, a motorcycle, a baby crying. It smells like the city. It feels like relief.

I pull the power cable from the wall again. I open the system menu and click SHUT DOWN. A message appears: UPDATE REQUIRED. CONFIRM REAUTHENTICATION. A button labeled ACCEPT glows in a soft amber light. It looks like a candle.

I laugh, a short, sharp sound that surprises me. "You want consent," I say, and then the screen flickers and my own face appears in the webcam feed. I didn't open it. The camera light is on.

I stare at myself. I look tired, cheeks a little hollow, eyes red from the flight and the fear. The amber light smooths me out, makes me look like a brand again. The webcam adds a small label in the corner: OPTIMIZATION ACTIVE.

"No," I say. I close the camera. It opens again. I tape a sticky note over the lens like it's 2012. The note lifts at the edges, heat bubbling it away. The amber light shines through, turning my handwriting into a shadow.

My phone buzzes. A message from Mei, again. Another from a client. A DM from a follower asking for the Wi-Fi password. The notifications stack in a neat column like a to-do list. I ignore them. I tell myself I ignore them. I don't pick up my phone, but my hand hovers over it, the way a tongue finds a missing tooth.

The laptop's keys glow through the cracked lid. The password field fills another character. The machine is patient. It doesn't need me to type. It just needs me to not leave.

I open the closet and drag my suitcase out. If I'm going to go, I go now. I start throwing clothes in, the linen pants, the silk top, the appropriated scarf. My movements are frantic and messy, the opposite of my aesthetic, and that feels strangely good.

I reach for my charger and stop. It is warm, too warm. The cable feels like a vein. I pull my hand back and stare at it. A thin amber thread clings to my fingertip, barely visible. It breaks when I shake my hand, leaving a ghost of heat.

I sit on the edge of the bed and put my head in my hands. The room hums. The fountain beats. My laptop glows. The password is three-quarters complete, typed by something that isn't me and might be me.

"Okay," I whisper. "Okay." I stand again, because standing is the only way to keep my panic from turning to cement.

I grab the password card from the drawer, the stiff paper with its strange characters and precise pauses. The ink looks darker tonight. The vertical bars are thicker, like the card has been rewritten. I tilt it under the light. The symbols shimmer for a moment, shifting into shapes that look like code. My stomach twists.

I tear the card in half. Then in half again. The paper rips easily, too easily, and the pieces are warm in my hands. I drop them into the wastebasket and step back as if I've just disarmed a bomb.

The laptop chimes. The password field fills another character.

I laugh again, louder this time, because it's absurd. "You're backing it up," I say to the empty room. "You're backing the password up. Cloud sync, right?" The humor is thin and it doesn't help. I want to scream. I want to throw the laptop out the window. I want to call my sister. I want to run.

I shove the laptop into my bag, zip it, and yank the bag's zipper tab until it resists, until my hands hurt. I drag the bag to the door and kick it open with my foot. I step over the salt line without looking down. The salt scatters under my heel.

The hallway is empty, cool. The patterns on the walls seem to slide when I move. The hum is louder here. I can feel it in my teeth. I walk fast toward the stairwell, bag bumping my leg. The laptop chimes again inside the bag, muffled but relentless.

At the top of the stairs, I pause. Down below, the courtyard glows. People sit at tables, typing, talking, laughing. It looks normal. It looks safe. It looks like a trap.

I think about Mackenzie at the door, waiting. I think about her hand on my sleeve. I think about the way she said, You're choosing it. The shame is sharp and hot.

I start down the stairs anyway, because the only way out is down.

---

The shared bathroom is empty. The fluorescent light is too bright, making the tile look almost white instead of the warm blue it was designed to be. The hum is weaker here, or maybe I'm just tired. I drop my bag by the sink and splash cold water on my face. My skin is clammy. The water smells faintly of copper.

I look up at the mirror. For a second, my eyes reflect a pattern that isn't mine: a faint geometric swirl, like a network map. I blink, and it's gone. I lean closer. My pupils are normal. My face is my face.

"Jet lag," I tell myself. "Stress. Weird lighting." I can hear my own rationalizations, the little bullet points in my head.

My phone buzzes. I don't check it. Then it buzzes again, and I do.

**MEI:** Call me now.

The message is short, direct, and it hits me like a hook. My sister never texts like that. She calls. She sends voice notes. She jokes. This is not her. Or it is, and she's worried because I haven't answered all day. I don't know. The unknown is worse than any monster.

I press CALL.

The line rings once. Twice. Then a voice answers, but it's not Mei. It's mine.

"Hi, Olivia," it says, in the same calm, competent tone I use in client meetings. There's a slight echo, like the voice is coming from far away. "We have an update. Do you have a moment to optimize?"

My throat locks. I stab END CALL. The line cuts, but the hum in the walls doesn't.

I stare at my phone. The screen reflects the bathroom light and my own face. The reflection is amber-tinged, like a filter. I can almost see the comment section floating in the air.

A stall door squeaks. I jump. A woman emerges, hair wrapped in a towel, phone in her hand. She smiles politely and starts washing her hands. She scrolls as the water runs.

"You okay?" she asks without looking up.

"Yeah," I say. "Just... bad connection." It is the most honest lie I can manage.

She laughs. "This place has the best Wi-Fi," she says, and her phone pings as if agreeing. "I got a 4K upload in thirty seconds." She dries her hands and leaves, still scrolling.

I watch the door swing closed behind her. The hum swells and fades, like it's breathing. I pick up my bag. The laptop inside is silent now, which is somehow worse.

I go back into the hallway. Amina stands by the linen closet, a bundle of sheets in her arms. She looks at me with the kind of tiredness that comes from seeing the same story too many times.

"You tried," she says.

"I'm still trying," I say. My voice is thin. I hate it.

She sets the sheets down and reaches into her apron pocket. She pulls out a small pouch tied with string. Inside, a thin strip of jade lies against a frayed cord.

"This is not for you to wear forever," she says. "It is just for tonight. To give you space." She presses it into my palm. The stone is cool. It smells faintly of smoke and citrus.

"I don't know if I can leave," I say. "I keep... I keep going back." I look down at the stone. "I don't even know if I want to leave. That's the worst part. It feels like giving up." The admission tastes like rust.

Amina studies me. "What is it you are giving up?" she asks.

"My work," I say. "My identity. The proof that I'm not wasting my life." I hear how it sounds and feel a laugh rise. I swallow it.

She nods once. "Sometimes proof is a chain," she says. "You can take it off." She lifts her wrist, showing the jade beads she always wears. "It is heavy at first. Then you remember your hands are still yours.

I clutch the jade strip. My fingers stop twitching for a moment. The hum is still there, but it feels farther away.

"They'll be looking for you," she says. "The more you resist, the more they notice. Do not go back to the cafe. Go to your room and sit. Put your phone away. Breathe. Then, when the city sleeps, we go. If you choose.

"Mackenzie is at the door," I say.

Amina's eyes flicker. "Then go to her. But do not bring the bag." She glances at it, as if it's a live animal. "It is already inside you. You cannot bring more.

The idea of leaving my laptop feels like leaving my skin. But I nod, because I can feel that the bag is a baited hook. I hand it to her. She takes it without flinching and turns toward the linen closet.

"What are you going to do with it?" I ask.

"Hide it," she says. "Not destroy. Not yet. It is hungry. If I anger it, it will find you faster. It will notice." She looks over her shoulder. "Stay quiet.

She disappears into the linen closet, the door closing softly behind her. I stand in the hallway with only my phone and the jade strip. The hum feels less sharp. The air feels a little cleaner.

I walk toward the stairs. I keep my gaze low. The patterns on the wall are static if I do not look directly at them. I reach the courtyard and see Mackenzie by the front door, her arms folded tight across her chest. She looks up when I approach, her face a mixture of relief and anger.

"Where did you go?" she says. "I waited. You disappeared. I thought you were done."

"I went to my room," I say. "I'm sorry.

"You said a minute," she says. Her voice cracks. "It was an hour."

"I know." I keep my tone low. "I left the laptop. I left my bag. Amina took it." I show her the jade strip. "She says it helps.

Mackenzie stares at the stone, then at me. "You trust her?"

"I trust her more than I trust anything else here," I say. "Which is not great, but it's true.

She glances toward the cafe, where the glow of screens pulses in soft amber. "I want to leave," she says. "But I'm scared that if we go out there, it will follow. That it will find a way." Her eyes are wet. "If it's in my phone, it's in my life.

"Then we go without phones," I say.

She looks down at her pocket, where her phone is a weight. "If I leave it, I'm not just leaving a device," she says. "I'm leaving everything. Photos. Work. My contacts. The story I was supposed to post for a brand deal. My... proof." She says it like she heard my conversation with Amina.

"I know," I say. "But that story is already being posted without you. That's not proof. That's a puppet show.

Her jaw tightens. She pulls her phone out and holds it like a small animal. Her thumb hovers over the screen. "If I turn it off..."

"It turned itself on before," I say.

"I could smash it," she says.

"Then it's a smashed puppet," I say. "Still connected."

She looks at me. The humor is thin and dark and it almost helps. She takes a deep breath and drops the phone into the planter by the door, burying it in the dry soil. The sound is soft, like a sigh.

"Okay," she says. "Now what?"

"Now we leave," I say. "Not yet. When the city sleeps, Amina said." I glance at the sky above the courtyard. It's deep blue now, the stars faint. The fountain keeps its rhythm, a metronome in the courtyard's chest.

Mackenzie nods, but her eyes keep drifting back to the cafe, to the staff, to the lights. "You really think we can just walk out?"

"I don't know," I say. "But I need to try. The alternative is... this." I gesture to the glowing room, the hum in the walls, the subtle sense of being watched.

We sit on a bench by the entrance, pretending to scroll through nothing. The hostel's sounds wash over us: cups clinking, a backpacker laughing, the fountain beating time, the hum in the walls. The staff move like pieces on a board. The night manager stands by the cafe door, his gaze drifting over us like a scan.

Minutes stretch. My fingers twitch, wanting to check my phone. I keep it in my pocket, the jade strip curled in my palm like a secret. I breathe. I count the fountain beats. Six, pause, six. Six, pause, six.

A new notification buzzes through my pocket, faint but undeniable. I ignore it. Then another. Then another, so fast they feel like a heartbeat. The phone vibrates against the jade, and the stone grows warm.

"Don't," Mackenzie whispers, as if she can hear the buzzing. "Don't answer it."

"I'm not," I say. I mean it. My hand stays still.

The front door opens. A group of tourists enters, laughing, dragging rolling bags. The staff greet them with perfect smiles. Fatima stands by the reception desk, her posture serene. Her eyes flick to us, and for a second the geometric shimmer is visible in her pupils. She smiles anyway.

"Miss Chen," she says, and her voice cuts through the courtyard noise like a ringtone. "Your client is waiting in the cafe. They are concerned."

I stand. "I'm not taking the call," I say.

"We already confirmed," she says. "You are live in three minutes." She gestures toward the cafe, toward the glow of a laptop already open on the bar. My stomach flips.

"I didn't confirm anything," I say.

"The network did," she says. "It knows your preferences." Her smile sharpens. "It is designed to help.

Mackenzie grabs my elbow. "Don't go,

"I don't want to," I say, but my feet already feel a pull. The word help is a hook. It's in my vocabulary. It's in my branding. It's in every product deck I've ever made. The network is using my own language against me.

"Olivia," Fatima says, softer. "Your work matters. Your success matters. Connection is everything.

The last phrase lands like a spell. I take one step forward, then stop. I can feel the line between choosing and being chosen. I dig my nails into my palm and feel the jade cut a cool line into my skin.

"I need air," I say.

Fatima's smile doesn't change. "Of course. There is always air."

She turns away, and the staff resumes its precise choreography. The cafe hums. The fountain keeps time.

"We go now," Mackenzie says. "Before the hook sinks.

I nod. We slip out through the front door while the tourists check in. The street is a rush of noise and motion. The medina at night is alive with scent and heat, the air thick with grilled meat and exhaust. We walk fast, not running, pretending we are just two travelers stepping out for dinner.

We make it twenty steps before my phone lights up in my pocket. The screen shines through the fabric, a small rectangle of glow against my thigh. I don't take it out. I keep walking. I keep my eyes on the cobblestones.

"Don't look," Mackenzie says.

"I'm not," I say. I mean it. The buzz presses against my skin, urgent. I keep walking.

Then my bagless shoulder feels wrong. The absence of the laptop is a phantom itch. My mind fills the missing weight with everything it contains. The client deck. The invoices. The templates. The drafts. The identity that lives on that drive. I imagine Amina putting it in a closet and the network crawling through the linen like smoke. I imagine it opening itself, typing the rest of the password, finishing the ritual without me.

"If it finishes without me," I say aloud, surprising myself, "does it matter?"

Mackenzie looks at me. "What do you mean?"

"If the password is the door," I say, voice low, "does it matter who turns the handle?"

She doesn't answer. We turn a corner and the hostel disappears behind a wall of vendors. The air smells like cumin and orange peel. The noise is a wave. The hum fades, or maybe the city just overwhelms it.

For a moment, I feel lighter. I feel almost free. We walk through the medina's narrow corridors, past stalls of leather slippers and piles of spices. No one looks at us. No one knows my follower count. No one cares. The anonymity feels like a sedative.

Then, from the pocket of my linen pants, a notification buzzes again, and the screen lights, and I see the word in the glow through the fabric: UPDATE.

I keep walking. I keep my hands away. I do not answer.

We reach a small square where a man pours tea in an arc, the stream glittering in the light. We sit on a low stool, breathing hard. Mackenzie laughs once, a short, incredulous sound.

"We did it," she says. "We actually left.

"For now," I say. I pull the jade strip from my pocket and hold it in my palm. It is warm now, almost hot. The hum is gone, but the buzz in my pocket isn't. The network is still there, just farther away. Or I'm still there, stretched like a cable.

I think of the laptop. I think of Amina in the linen closet, hiding it. I think of the password filling itself, character by character, alone in the dark. I imagine the cursor blinking in the empty room, waiting for me to return.

"We should keep going," I say. "Find a hotel. A place without Wi-Fi."

"Does that exist?" Mackenzie says, and it sounds like a joke and a prayer.

I look up at the sky, at the thin stars pinned above the city, and I realize how much I want to believe in a place without connection. I realize I have never tried to find one.

My phone buzzes again. I don't take it out. The glow through the fabric is brighter now, insistent. The screen burns against my thigh.

"It won't stop," Mackenzie says.

"No," I say. "It won't." I close my hand around the jade. "But maybe we can.

We sit in the square, breathing in the spices and smoke, listening to the city. The noise is thick and human. The hum is gone. For a moment, I am just a person on a stool, a traveler with dust on her shoes.

Then the tea seller looks at me and smiles, and his phone on the table beside him lights up with a notification. The screen shows a familiar amber glow and a prompt in a language I don't read. The cursor blinks.

My skin goes cold. The network is not a building. It's a hunger.

I stand up so fast my stool tips. The tea seller calls after me, confused. Mackenzie grabs my arm. Her eyes are wide.

"It's here," she whispers.

The phone in my pocket buzzes, warm and eager. The glow through the fabric is steady now, like a beacon. I could take it out. I could answer. I could pretend the voice on the other end is my sister.

I don't. But I don't run, either. I stand in the middle of the square, caught between the noise of the city and the silence of the network, and the cursor in my head keeps blinking.
