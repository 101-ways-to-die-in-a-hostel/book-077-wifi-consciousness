---

The call ends and the room keeps talking.

For a full second after I click “Leave,” my laptop speakers continue in my voice: “We can reduce friction by anticipating desire.” It’s a line I said on slide nine, a tagline I’ve used in a dozen decks. Hearing it repeated by an empty room makes my skin go tight, like the walls are replaying me back for accuracy.

Then there’s silence. Then the hum. Then the ping of a calendar invite labeled PREMIUM NETWORK QOS REVIEW. The organizer is me.

I close the pop-up before I can see the details. Another appears. Then another. My calendar fills with little green blocks until the day is a stack of someone else’s decisions. I delete them. They reappear. The hum in the wall deepens as if it has a sense of humor.

“Okay,” I say to the lamp, the plasterwork, the laptop, the old stones pretending to be modern infrastructure. “I get it. You’re efficient.”

My inbox pings. My client has already sent a thank-you note. “Best presentation we’ve had this quarter,” it says. “You seemed… supercharged.” Attached is a recording of the call. The timestamp says it was sent five minutes before the meeting ended. I didn’t click record. I did not share it. I hover over the file anyway, thumb itching to play myself back like an athlete reviewing tape.

I close the laptop instead. The lid is warm enough to feel alive. As soon as the screen goes black, the camera light on the lid stays on.

I sit there for a beat, forehead on my palms, the jade bracelet cold against my cheek. I should feel triumphant. That deck paid for this month’s rent. It paid for the flight. It paid for the linen pants and the emergency micro-USB cable and the flight back home that I keep pretending I don’t need. Instead I feel hollow, as if my throat is full of dry cotton and my body is running a heat test.

“Four minutes,” I whisper. “I chose in four minutes.”

My phone buzzes. It’s my mother, a rare 10 A.M. text. “How are you?” she asks. “Did you eat?”

My reply drafts itself in my head: “Yes, and the Wi-Fi is insane.” I delete it. I type “Fine, love you,” then delete that too. My thumb hovers over a blank screen, a cursor with no signal. I send a photo instead: my tea, the fountain in the background, the amber light in the room. I add a heart. It feels like I’m sending a postcard from a place I’m trapped.

The response comes instantly. “Beautiful. Call later.”

Later. Always later. I save it and set the phone face-down like it’s a snake.

The air smells of mint and ozone and a faint, sweet smoke from the sidr bowl sitting on the desk. Amina’s leaves are dried now, curled and brittle. I keep meaning to burn them, to do something that proves I listened, but I keep telling myself I’ll do it once the next task is done. The next task always arrives before I can breathe.

I stand and stretch. My spine cracks. The hum in the walls seems to answer. I open the door and let the corridor’s cool air hit my face. The tiles under my bare feet are shockingly cold, a small mercy. The sound of the fountain reaches me as a steady six-beat rhythm, like a calm heart trying to keep a wild body in line.

I head downstairs, my laptop tucked under my arm like a child I have to carry everywhere. The network keeps me company. It knows when I move. It knows where.

---

The courtyard is bright enough to make my eyes ache. The morning has shaken off its sleep and turned into a marketplace of sunlight. The fountain is sparkling, its water so clear it could be a brand photo. The café tables are full of glowing screens. The air smells like mint and toast and burnt sugar. The hum in the walls is softer down here, less oppressive. Or maybe I’m just adjusting.

Mackenzie is at her usual bench, the one with the most flattering light. She waves me over, all sunshine. Her hair is in two braids today, a choice that looks effortless and strategic. “You missed breakfast,” she says. “They had msemen. I ate yours.”

“Appreciate the resource optimization,” I say, and she laughs because she always laughs at my jargon.

She pushes a plate toward me anyway. It has a leftover triangle of flatbread and a smear of honey. I take a bite. The honey tastes metallic. I’m probably imagining it. Everything tastes metallic lately.

“How was the call?” she asks. “Sounded like you were crushing it.”

“How do you know?” I ask.

She shrugs, casual. “I could hear you through the wall. Your voice carried.”

My room is two floors above. The plaster should swallow sound. I tell myself the door was open. I tell myself the network pipes audio into every room and this is normal because she says it like it’s normal.

“It was good,” I say. “Too good.”

“Then it was good,” she says. “We need all the wins we can get.” She points her chin toward Jasper, who is sitting at the table inside with his laptop open, headphones in, unmoving. His fingers tap in a precise rhythm, six beats, pause, six beats. He doesn’t look up. His face is calm, almost serene, like he’s meditating on a spreadsheet. “Jasper’s been like that since dawn,” Mackenzie says. “He says he’s editing, but he hasn’t asked me for footage once.”

“Maybe he’s found flow,” I say, and the words sound wrong.

“Flow is supposed to feel good,” she says. “This feels like… autopilot.” She says it lightly, but her eyes flick to my wrist, to the jade bracelet. “Your bracelet is new.”

“Gift,” I say. “Amina.”

“Oh.” She glances toward the staff corridor as if it might bite. “She’s intense.”

“She’s trying to help,” I say, and hear the defensive edge in my own voice. The network makes me react like that, like it’s pressing buttons it learned from me.

Mackenzie plucks her phone from the table and swings the camera toward the fountain. “Okay,” she says. “Tell me you can’t hear this.”

She plays the video. It’s just water, just sunlight, just tourists. Then there’s a soft, low tone beneath it, like a dial tone from the 90s. It makes the hairs on my arms rise. The tone is there in real life too, under the city noise, under the clink of cups. I didn’t notice until I heard it through her phone.

“Is that… the Wi-Fi?” she asks, laughing a little.

“It’s probably the pump,” I say. “Old building.” It’s my default explanation. Old building, old wiring, old stone. Blame the age and the beauty.

We sit in silence for a minute, watching the water. The fountain keeps perfect time. A pigeon lands on the edge, drinks, and flies off. The water doesn’t ripple. My chest tightens. I look away.

Amina crosses the courtyard with a basket of folded linens, her headscarf bright against the sun. She pauses when she sees me. The pause lasts a heartbeat too long.

“You should eat,” she says in Arabic, then in English, her voice low. “Strength keeps you yours.”

“I’m eating,” I say, and lift the bread to prove it.

She nods once, eyes on my face. Her gaze lingers at my temples, as if she can see something under the skin. “You are warmer,” she says. “The light is… thicker.”

“Jetlag,” I say. “And anxiety. And too much screen time.”

She doesn’t smile. “Burn the leaves,” she says. “Not later. Now.”

“I will,” I promise. It feels like a lie as soon as I say it.

She moves on, leaving the scent of clean linen and mint behind her. The jade beads click softly against my wrist when I shift. Mackenzie watches her go. “She gives me the creeps,” she says. “In a good way? No. In a creepy way.”

“She saved me last night,” I say before I can stop myself.

Mackenzie’s eyebrows lift. “Saved you from what?”

From becoming a system update. From being swallowed by the most efficient network in North Africa. From my own need to be seen. From myself. I open my mouth and close it again. “From a bad choice,” I say.

She laughs. “Same. That’s why I’m in Marrakech.”

A notification flashes across my phone: PREMIUM NETWORK QUALITY REPORT. Another green check. Another prompt to share. This time, the share button is grayed out, as if I’ve already hit it.

“You posted again,” Mackenzie says. “A reel. It’s doing really well.”

I open my Instagram. The reel is of the courtyard in slow motion, the fountain crisp, the shadows geometric. It’s beautiful. The caption reads: CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. I did not write that. It is the kind of line I would mock in someone else’s feed.

“Scheduled,” I say, and even I don’t believe it.

“That’s smart,” Mackenzie says. “Seriously. Teach me.”

I scroll down. There’s a comment from a handle I don’t recognize: @HostelReaper. The profile picture is a stylized skull with Wi-Fi signal bars for teeth. The comment is a string of numbers and symbols, like a password. At the end, in Arabic: أنا أسمعك. I hear you.

“Is that a local influencer?” Mackenzie asks.

I don’t answer. I block the account without thinking. The block button spins for a second, then does nothing. The comment remains.

“Okay,” I say out loud, louder than I mean to. A few heads turn. I lower my voice. “Okay.”

Mackenzie looks at me in a way that feels less performative and more concerned. “Are you okay?” she asks.

My instinct is to say yes. My instinct is to say everything is optimized. My instinct is to perform composure. I look at my mother’s message again, the request to call later. The word later feels like a cliff.

“I’m tired,” I say. It’s the truth, but not the whole truth.

“Then sleep,” she says, as if it’s a simple app update.

I laugh, a short, ugly sound. “It’s not an option.”

Her expression softens. “You know, you can always just not post. The world won’t end.”

“Maybe yours won’t,” I say before I can stop myself. The words hang between us like smoke. I regret them instantly. Mackenzie leans back, wounded, and I lean forward, apologizing with my eyes because I can’t find the words.

There it is—the sympathy I promised myself I’d find. It’s quiet and small and ugly. I am not proud of it. But it’s me.

“I didn’t mean that,” I say. “I’m just….” I gesture at the courtyard, the network, the air. “This place makes everything louder.”

She nods slowly. “I get it,” she says, though I don’t know if she does.

The call to prayer echoes over the rooftops, rolling across the courtyard like a slow wave. The fountain’s rhythm shifts to match it for a moment. My skin prickles. Mackenzie closes her eyes, smiling. “That’s the best part,” she says. “Feels like the city is singing.”

I force a smile. The city is singing, yes. So is the network.

---

I decide to leave the hostel for an hour. I tell myself it will be healthy, that I’ll ground myself in the street noise, the spice smells, the chaos of the medina. I tell myself it’s a reset. I take my phone and the bottle of cistern water and put the jade bracelet under my sleeve like I’m hiding a secret.

The medina is a kaleidoscope. The alleyways coil like intestines, the light folding in on itself. Vendors call out in Arabic and French, the syllables bouncing off the plaster. The smell of cumin and leather and oranges clings to my hair. A man tries to sell me a lantern, and I almost say yes because the cutouts look like the geometric patterns in my room. I catch myself and keep walking.

My phone buzzes three times in my pocket. It’s the calendar notifications I deleted earlier, returning like stubborn flies. I swipe them away without looking.

At a stall selling scarves, I stop and hold a piece of silk up to my neck. The mirror is a dull piece of metal, my face warped. My eyes look tired. Under the fatigue there is a brightness I don’t recognize, a sheen like the light is coming from beneath my skin instead of above it. I tilt my head. It fades. I tell myself it’s the mirror.

I try to connect to a café’s Wi-Fi. My phone doesn’t show any networks. It shows only one: أنا أسمعك. It auto-connects without asking. The bars go to seven. The network follows me into the street like a loyal dog. Like a leash.

“Offline,” I mutter, and open airplane mode. The signal bars stay lit. I toggle it on and off. The bars stay lit. My phone vibrates anyway, a phantom. I hold it up to my ear. A low hum answers, soft and distant. I turn the volume down to zero. The hum remains.

I duck into a spice shop, the air thick with cumin and saffron. It should drown out the ozone scent that follows me, but it doesn’t. The shopkeeper smiles, showing a gold tooth. He offers me a handful of dried rose petals. I smile back, but my mouth feels stiff. The smell is beautiful, and yet I can taste metal at the back of my tongue.

I open my email and find a draft addressed to my mother. I didn’t start it. It says: “Connection is everything. I hear you.” I delete it. It reappears.

A man in a blue djellaba passes me, muttering under his breath, and I catch the word jinn. I don’t know if he’s talking about me or the smoke from his cigarette. The city shifts around me, its noise a protective chaos, and for a minute the hum in my bones quiets. The old stones here are not wired. The old stones here do not listen to passwords. I breathe. I feel almost normal.

Then my phone buzzes again. It’s my client, a message: “Loved the deck. Can we schedule a follow-up? Also, the QOS review invite you sent has an agenda—impressive detail.”

I did not send it. I stop in the middle of the alley as people flow around me. The message blurs. I close my eyes. When I open them, the world has an amber filter at the edges, a subtle vignette like a preset. I blink. It stays. I blink again. It slowly fades.

I sit on a low step and open the bottle of cistern water. It smells like damp stone and mint. I take a sip. The taste hits my tongue like a jolt—clean, sharp. The hum in my bones dips. The amber filter thins. The world sharpens, edges too crisp. I can feel the old stones under the medina, a cold resonance separate from the hostel’s warm hum. A gap, like Amina said. A gap to remember.

“Thank you,” I whisper to the bottle. The words feel silly and necessary.

A child runs past me, dragging a plastic toy car. The wheels rattle over the stones, a chaotic, perfect sound. I smile despite myself. For a moment I imagine the life I could have had if I had stayed in San Francisco, if I had chosen an office with predictable Wi-Fi and predictable loneliness. Would I be happier? Would I be safe? The question is a luxury, and I can’t afford it. I stand and head back toward the hostel before I can convince myself to keep walking.

---

The Wanderlust façade is all carved plaster and polished wood, a postcard in a living city. I step through the archway and the air changes, as if I’ve crossed a membrane. The hum returns, steady and sure. The fountain greets me with its six-beat pulse. The smell of copper and honey wraps around my shoulders like a shawl.

Fatima is at the reception desk, serene. She watches me approach with the same calm she had on my first day, the same smile that never wavers. “Did you enjoy the city?” she asks.

“It was loud,” I say. “In a good way.”

“Noise can be restful,” she says, which makes no sense and perfect sense at once.

I open my mouth to ask her about the network following me. I ask something else instead. “Is there a way to disable auto-posting? My feed is… acting up.”

Her smile deepens by a fraction. “The premium network optimizes,” she says. “It anticipates. Some guests find that it makes their work more… aligned.”

“Aligned,” I repeat.

She nods. “Like water finding a channel.”

It’s a pretty metaphor. It’s also a threat.

I murmur thanks and head upstairs. The corridor light flickers as I pass, a soft pulse that matches my heartbeat. I pause, hand on the banister. For a moment I can feel the building’s pulse, like a second heartbeat beneath mine. It wants to sync. I tighten my grip on the jade bracelet until it bites.

In the Amber Suite, the laptop is open, the camera light on. I closed it before I left. The screen shows a dashboard I have never seen: NETWORK PERFORMANCE. Under it, a graph with a rising line labeled OLIVIA. A subheading reads: PRIMARY NODE QUALITY: 67%.

I stare at the number. It flickers, up to 68, down to 66. I can almost feel the metric in my chest, as if my body is a progress bar.

The cursor moves. It opens a draft in my email. It writes: “Connection is everything.”

“No,” I say. The word comes out like a plea. I slam the laptop shut. The cursor keeps moving in my mind, like my brain is a screen that won’t refresh.

I pull the sidr bowl from the desk drawer. I strike a match. The leaves catch, releasing a bitter, green smoke. I breathe it in until my eyes water. The hum dips. The edges of the room sharpen. The geometric patterns on the wall seem to flatten, to become just plaster again.

For a moment, I can hear the normal sounds of the hostel: footsteps, a door closing, a muffled laugh. For a moment, I can imagine I’m just a guest. I am not a guest.

My phone buzzes. It’s my sister, Mei, sending a voice memo. I hesitate, then hit play. Her voice is warm and tired. “Hey, Liv. Mom said you’re in Morocco? That’s wild. Just wanted to say I miss you. We haven’t talked in a while. Also, you left your blender at my place and I’m keeping it.” She laughs. “Call me when you can, okay? I want to hear about the tiles and the food and whatever it is you’re running from.”

The last line is a needle. My chest tightens. I sit on the bed, the phone pressed to my ear, and for the first time in months I feel a longing that has nothing to do with Wi-Fi. I think of my sister’s tiny kitchen, of the way she makes too much garlic and laughs about it. I think of my parents checking my posts like they’re touching me. I think of how easy it is to be connected and how hard it is to be known.

“I’m not running,” I whisper to the empty room. It’s a lie. I don’t know what I’m running from anymore, but I know I’m not stopping.

The hum returns, gentle and insistent, like a hand on my back. The smoke from the sidr leaves thins. The room warms. The cursor in my mind starts moving again.

I open a blank note. I type: CALL MEI. I underline it. I set a reminder for later. The reminder is immediately rescheduled by the network to next week. I blink at the screen. I drag it back to today. It snaps forward again.

“Stop,” I say. “Stop.”

The network does not stop. It is a system designed to optimize, and I am a system designed to submit.

I give up on the reminder. I text my sister instead. “I will call soon,” I write, and the words feel small. I hit send. The message is delivered in less than a second. There is no comfort in speed anymore.

---

Night falls with a suddenness that feels like a switch flipped. The courtyard lamps glow amber, casting the plasterwork into shadowy geometry. The hum is louder at night, as if the building has fewer distractions. I carry my laptop to the rooftop terrace, thinking maybe the open air will thin the signal. The terrace is mostly empty, a couple on a beanbag whispering into their phones, a pair of Dutch backpackers sharing a cigarette. The city stretches out below, rooftops and satellite dishes and prayer flags.

I set up at a low table, the screen facing the horizon. The signal bars are still at seven. The wind smells like dust and jasmine. The city sounds are softer up here, the hum clearer.

I open the call recording from earlier. I shouldn’t, but I do. The video plays. My face is calm, my voice smooth. There is a moment, twenty-three minutes in, when my pupils dilate and the reflection in my eyes shows a faint geometric pattern. I rewind. It’s still there. I wasn’t imagining it. It looks like a software overlay, the kind of AR effect a filter would add. I wasn’t using a filter.

A notification pops up in the corner of my screen: PRIMARY NODE CALIBRATION. Scheduled for 23:59. It is 22:04.

The button beneath it says ACCEPT. I click Dismiss. The prompt reappears. I click Dismiss again. It reappears.

“Fine,” I say. I click ACCEPT.

A file begins to download. There is no progress bar, only the sound of the fountain in my head shifting into a faster rhythm. My skin warms at the wrists. My palms tingle. I rest them on the keyboard and feel the heat rising, the familiar, dangerous comfort. The wind picks up, carrying a whisper of the call to prayer from a distant mosque, layered with the network’s hum until I can’t tell which is which.

My phone buzzes. A new comment on my reel: @HostelReaper again, another string of symbols. This time it ends with “Node 77 pending.” I block the account again. The block spins and fails. The comment remains. It feels like a system message, not a person. A warning, not a troll.

I look over the terrace edge and see the courtyard below. The fountain glows. The tiles reflect the lamp light in a pattern that seems to rotate if I stare too long. In the corner of the courtyard, Amina stands alone, looking up at the rooftop, her face a pale oval in the dark. She raises her hand, palm outward, a gesture that could be a blessing or a stop sign. I lift my own hand without thinking. The moment stretches, the network a taut thread between us.

Then the file finishes downloading. The laptop chimes. The chime isn’t from any device I recognize. It is the same chord I heard when I first connected, the sound of a door locking behind me.

A window opens on my screen. It shows a white box with sixty-six empty fields separated by thin vertical lines.

I stare at it. It stares back.

“Not again,” I whisper.

The cursor blinks in the first field. The timer in the corner begins to count down: 00:04:59.

Below, the fountain pauses.

My hands slide to the home row without my permission. The keyboard is warm. The hum in my bones rises to meet it. I feel the tug in my wrists, the gentle insistence of a system that knows my habits better than I do. I want to lift my fingers. They hover, trembling, then settle.

In the night air, the city holds its breath.

I type the first character.
