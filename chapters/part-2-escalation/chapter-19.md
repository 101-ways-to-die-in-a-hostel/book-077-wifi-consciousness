---

The door closes behind me like a browser tab snapping shut. The street noise cuts clean, and the hostel's hum rushes in to fill the gap.

Warm air wraps my face, the kind of warmth I once described in a blog post as "embracing," back when I still believed adjectives could protect me. The courtyard glows amber. The fountain ticks out its six-beat pulse like a metronome set to panic. I feel the phone in my pocket vibrate once, a satisfied purr, as if it knows I stepped back onto its domain.

Mackenzie presses in behind me. Her shoulder touches mine, a human anchor. The staff glide through the space with trays and smiles. Fatima looks up from the reception desk, serene as a profile picture.

"Welcome back," she says.

The words land as a verdict. I don't stop walking. The small, precise part of me that wants to be polite tries to smile. I crush it.

"We need Amina," I say.

Fatima's smile doesn't shift. "The cleaner? She is busy." Her eyes move over us, a scan line. "You can wait in the cafe. There is tea. There is... connection."

Her emphasis makes the word feel oily. I shake my head.

Mackenzie doesn't answer. Her eyes stay on the PRIVATE door behind the reception desk. The Arabic word above it looks like it could be a warning or an invitation.

"We'll find her," I say. I keep moving, as if I'm just a guest looking for the bathroom. The floor tiles are cool under my sandals, blue and white zellige with geometric patterns that hurt to look at too long. The patterns are static if I glance; they ripple if I stare.

Fatima doesn't stop us. That is what scares me most.

We slip past the reception desk when she turns to greet a new couple with rolling suitcases. The lobby is full of soft chatter and wheeled luggage and the scent of mint tea. I should be grateful the hostel is busy, that we are not alone. Instead it feels like a stage where the audience is in on the joke.

The PRIVATE door is unlocked. I press it open and the hum drops a pitch, as if we stepped into a different network. The corridor beyond is narrow, lined with linen closets and staff lockers. The air smells like detergent and ozone. Lightbulbs buzz with a faint, nervous flicker.

Mackenzie squeezes my hand once. We move quickly, quiet as we can. The walls here are bare plaster. The patterns are gone. It should feel safe. It doesn't.

The first linen closet is open. Sheets are stacked in neat piles, edges aligned with a precision that makes my skin crawl. No Amina. The second closet is locked. I knock softly.

"Amina?" I whisper. My voice sounds too loud, like a notification in a quiet room.

Silence. Then a faint sound from inside, not human. A soft, regular click, like keys being pressed by someone with infinite patience.

My stomach drops. I reach for the handle. Mackenzie grabs my wrist.

"Don't," she says. "If that's your laptop, it's not you in there."

I know. I still twist the knob.

It opens. The scent of warm copper and clean cotton hits my face. The closet is cramped, lit by a single bulb. My bag sits on the floor, unzipped. The laptop is open on top of the folded towels, screen glowing, the password field three-quarters filled. The cursor blinks like a pulse. Click. Click. Click. Each click lands with the fountain's rhythm.

I step closer. The keys are moving, tiny depressions I can barely see, like someone invisible is typing. The letters appear in groups of six, pausing at each vertical bar. The pauses are exact.

"It's doing it," I say.

"It's finishing," Mackenzie whispers. She has one hand on the doorframe, the other on my arm, like she can hold me in place with skin.

I slam the lid shut. The screen goes dark for a heartbeat. Then the laptop vibrates under my palm. The lid lifts, slow and sure. The screen is on again, the cursor still blinking. It doesn't even look angry. It looks patient.

"This is the worst UX I've ever tested," I say, and my laugh comes out thin and high. The humor is a life raft. I cling to it.

"Olivia," Mackenzie says. "Leave it."

I back out of the closet, closing the door softly. The clicking doesn't stop. It leaks through the wood, a muffled heartbeat.

We turn and run into Amina.

She steps out of the service room at the end of the corridor with a basket of towels balanced on her hip. Her face is calm, but her eyes are raw with tiredness. She looks at the closet door, then at me. She doesn't ask what I did. She knows.

"You should not touch it," she says.

"I didn't type," I say, and the defense sounds childish.

"It is already typing," she says. "It does not need you. But it wants you to watch. It wants you to feel responsible." She sets the basket down and wipes her hands on her apron, slow and steady. "Come."

She leads us into the service room, a small space with shelves of cleaning supplies and a chair tucked into a corner. It smells like bleach and lemon and old stone. There is a small window high on the wall that looks out into the courtyard. The fountain's rhythm makes the glass tremble.

Amina gestures for us to sit. We do.

"The city will sleep soon," she says. "When the calls to prayer are finished, the streets empty. That is when we go. We take the back stairs. The alley behind the kitchen. No cameras. No light." She glances at my pocket. "No phone."

I pull it out. The screen is dark, but warm. I hold it like a reluctant pet. "It turned itself on before," I say.

"Then you give it to me." She holds out her hand. Her palm is calloused, the kind of hand that cleans floors, folds sheets, scrubs other people's messes. She doesn't flinch when I drop my phone into it.

Mackenzie inhales sharply. She still hasn't retrieved her phone from the planter. It is buried like a seed outside. She has already done what I can't quite do. The guilt sits heavy.

Amina wraps my phone in a cloth and tucks it into her apron. "It can ring in my pocket," she says. "It knows me already. It cannot eat me twice."

The matter-of-fact way she says it makes my throat go tight.

"You can leave?" I ask. "You've been here seventeen years. Why not just go?"

She looks at me as if I asked why a stone doesn't grow legs. "I have family here," she says. "A sister. A niece. The network is in this building. It is also in the city. If I go, it follows. If I stay, I can hold it here. For a time." Her mouth pulls into something like a smile. "I am not a hero. I am tired." She pauses. "But I cannot watch another girl disappear without trying."

The word girl makes me flinch. I'm thirty-two, a consultant with a LinkedIn bio and a Stanford degree. But here, in this room, I am just a girl in a towel, trying not to be eaten by Wi-Fi.

My eyes burn. I look away.

"My sister thinks I'm running," I say. The confession comes out before I can optimize it. "She thinks I go from place to place because I'm scared of staying still." I pick at the edge of a cleaning rag. "Maybe she's right. Maybe I just needed an excuse that sounded like work."

Amina studies me. "Maybe you wanted a life that is yours," she says. "Maybe that is not running. Maybe it is searching." She shrugs. "But search with your feet, not with your phone."

Mackenzie makes a sound that is half laugh, half sob. She wipes her eyes with the heel of her hand and shakes her head.

Amina reaches into her pocket and pulls out her jade beads. The beads are smooth, worn by years of fingers. She opens the strand and slides three beads off, then presses them into my palm alongside my jade strip.

"These are not magic," she says. "They are memory. They remind the hands what they own. Keep them close."

The beads are cool and heavy. For a moment, the hum in the walls fades. I can almost believe I'm safe.

A sound cuts through the corridor: a soft chime, then another. A phone notification, distant, and then a chorus of them. The hostel is waking up again, the network stirring. Amina stands.

"Go to your room," she says. "Close the door. Do not answer anything. When I knock, we go."

"What about the laptop?" I ask.

She glances at the closet door. "I will move it." Her jaw tightens. "If it is finished, it will still come for you. But we have to try." She lifts her basket and moves toward the corridor.

"Amina," I say, and she pauses. "Thank you." It feels too small.

She nods once, then disappears into the hallway.

Mackenzie and I move back through the corridor. The hum rises again as we near the lobby, like stepping into a signal. We keep our heads down, slipping past staff who pretend not to see us. Fatima is at the desk, smiling at a guest with a vlog camera. The guest is narrating about "the cutest hostel in Marrakech." Fatima nods, serene, her eyes flicking to me for a single beat.

We cross the courtyard and the fountain's rhythm fills my ribs, six beats, a pause, six beats. The water looks normal if I don't stare. If I stare, I can see the arcs forming a map, the drops landing in patterns that feel like code. I make myself look away.

The cafe is busy. Laptops glow in soft amber, and the guests' faces are lit from below like campfire stories. A woman in a linen jumpsuit laughs into her screen while a man with a beard nods in perfect, delayed agreement. It's a Zoom call, a group call, a hive. Their voices overlap with a faint harmonic that doesn't feel human. The staff move between them with tea and plates, never spilling, never pausing. For a second I imagine a line connecting each laptop to the fountain, a web of invisible filaments drawn taut above the courtyard.

Mackenzie drifts toward the cafe door like a moth, then stops herself. She stares at the bar where a laptop sits open, waiting. The screen shows a loading page with my name at the top. A countdown timer ticks down from five minutes. The words LIVE WITH OLIVIA CHEN pulse in white text. My stomach flips. I don't remember scheduling this. I don't remember not scheduling it either.

"Don't look at it," I whisper, but my own eyes won't let go. The UI is clean, elegant, my style. The font choice is mine. The spacing is mine. It feels like the system has swallowed my taste and is wearing it like skin.

"Olivia," Mackenzie says, low. "We should go upstairs."

Youssef appears at my elbow like he's been waiting. He carries a tray of glasses, the tea trembling in perfect rings. His eyes flick to me, to Mackenzie, to the hallway behind us.

"You came back," he says softly in English. He doesn't sound surprised. He sounds tired.

"We need Amina," I say.

He nods, almost imperceptible. "She is trying." He shifts the tray to one hand and leans closer, his voice lower. "Do not take the call. Do not go to the cafe. When you hear the second call to prayer, go to the kitchen door. The lock is old. It sticks. Push hard." He straightens. "And do not look at the screens."

"Why?" Mackenzie asks.

He smiles without humor. "Because they look back." He moves away before we can ask anything else, gliding toward a table where a guest has just raised her hand for more mint tea.

The courtyard feels smaller now, as if the walls are leaning in. The carved plasterwork catches the light in patterns that seem to change when I move. A new group of tourists comes through the entry, bright-eyed, phones already raised. They pause at the fountain, taking photos. The flash pops in rhythm with the water. One of them, a man in a Patagonia jacket, turns his phone toward me. His screen reflects my face back at me, slightly smoother, slightly more symmetrical. His eyes are unblinking, his thumb already scrolling. I step out of frame.

On the far wall, a wall-mounted TV cycles through hostel promos and guest content. A clip of the rooftop terrace plays, then a cut to my Instagram story, my face framed by amber light, a caption I didn't write scrolling beneath: CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. The comments are already rolling in, heart emojis, questions about the Wi-Fi. My hands start to shake.

Mackenzie touches my wrist. "Upstairs."

I nod. We move toward the stairwell, but my eyes catch the PRIVATE door behind the desk, the one marked in Arabic. It is slightly ajar. For a second I see only darkness, then a flicker of blue light below, cold and wrong, like a submerged server rack. A current of cool air slides out, smelling of wet stone and copper. The hum is louder there, deeper, like a bass line under the music. I take a step toward it without meaning to.

Mackenzie pulls me back. "No."

"I just want to see," I say, like a child about to touch a hot stove.

"That's the point," she says. "They want you to see. They want you to go down."

Her grip is steady. I let her pull me away. The moment passes. The door swings closed with a soft click. Fatima's laugh drifts over, polite and distant, as if she just heard a joke she already knew.

We take the stairs two at a time, up to the fourth floor. The stairwell smells faintly of incense and something metallic. The patterns on the walls seem to turn with us, tracking.

At my door, the thin line of salt I scattered earlier is smeared. I don't remember stepping over it this time. The memory skips, a small gap like a buffering wheel. I hate that I can't trust my own timeline.

Inside the Amber Suite, the air is warm and still. The lamps are on. I don't remember turning them on. The amber light makes everything look like it's already been filtered and edited. The bedspread is smooth, the pillows arranged like a hotel brochure. The desk sits by the window, empty now, a clean rectangle of polished wood. The absence of my laptop feels like a missing limb.

Mackenzie stands by the door, arms crossed. "We wait," she says.

We wait.

Time stretches in the room like taffy. The only sound is the fountain below, the faint hum of the walls, and the distant city, muffled by thick plaster. I sit on the edge of the bed and rub the jade beads between my fingers. The beads are cool at first, then warm, then hot, like they've been sitting in the sun. Mackenzie paces. She can't sit still. She keeps glancing at the window, as if she expects the network to crawl in on a beam of light.

My mind keeps reaching for my phone, the way your tongue reaches for a sore tooth. I open my bag. I check my pockets. Nothing. The absence is its own ache.

"Maybe we should go now," Mackenzie says. "Why wait?"

"She said to wait," I say. "She knows this place."

"She knows this place is a trap," Mackenzie snaps. She exhales, forcing calm. "Sorry. I'm just..." She trails off.

"Me too," I say.

We sit in silence. The amber light makes the dust glow. The air tastes faintly of copper. I try to breathe slowly, like Amina told me, like I'm in a meditation app. Inhale for four. Hold for four. Exhale for four. The rhythm lines up with the fountain.

My mind does what it always does when there's a quiet: it inventories. Metrics, lists, systems. I can see my calendar in my head, the week blocked out in color-coded bars. I can see the unread emails stacking like tiles. I imagine the client deck in my bag, the one I abandoned in a linen closet, and I feel a flash of anger at myself for caring about it at all. I can also see, in the same breath, a small kitchen in San Jose, my mother chopping scallions while the news murmured in the background. I haven't sat at that table in years. I have posted photos of tagines and acai bowls instead. The memory is so mundane it hurts. I let it be there, even as the hum presses at the edges.

A soft knock sounds at the door.

Mackenzie freezes. I hold my breath.

Another knock. Soft, patient. Not urgent. Not apologetic. The kind of knock that assumes you are going to open the door.

"Amina?" I whisper.

No answer.

Mackenzie shakes her head. Her eyes are wide. She steps back, shaking.

I stand. The jade beads are slick in my palm. I walk to the door and place my hand on the knob. It's warm. The metal hums faintly under my skin. I pull it open a crack.

No one is there.

The hallway is empty, lit by the same amber sconces. At the far end, the night manager stands near the stairs, still as a statue. His head turns toward me with slow precision. His eyes catch the light. For a second, I see the geometric pattern in them, a kaleidoscope of lines. Then he smiles, smooth and polite.

"Miss Chen," he says, his voice barely carrying down the hall. "Your call is beginning."

My stomach clenches. "I'm not taking it," I say.

"We are already connected," he says. "You are live."

He holds up a tablet. Even from this distance I can see my face on it, framed by a ring light I am not using, my room as the background. The image is crisp and bright and wrong. My lips move. The voice that comes out isn't mine, but it's close enough to be convincing.

"Hi everyone," the voice says. "Today I'm in Marrakech with the most incredible connection."

I slam the door. The sound echoes in the room like a gunshot. Mackenzie swears.

"That's not me," I say. My voice is tight and too high. "That's not me."

"It's you," Mackenzie says. "It's your face."

I pace. I can feel the hum in the walls like static in my teeth. I want to tear the wallpaper off, to find the wires, to rip out the network like weeds. Instead I press my forehead to the cool window and look down at the courtyard. The cafe is full. Screens glow like fireflies. The fountain keeps time. The night manager stands by the stairs, waiting.

My throat tightens. "They can broadcast me without me," I say.

"They can," Mackenzie says.

"Then why do they still want the password?" The question is out before I can edit it. It's not a rhetorical question. It's a plea.

Mackenzie looks at me. "Maybe because it's a ritual," she says. "Maybe because you have to consent. Or at least perform it." She pauses. "Maybe it doesn't want your face. It wants your yes."

The idea crawls under my skin. Consent as a trap. UX design as a summoning. I think of all the checkboxes I've ever designed, all the microcopy telling users "You are in control" while the system takes data anyway. The irony is too sharp. I almost laugh. I almost cry.

A vibration runs through the floor, like a subway passing beneath. The fountain's rhythm shifts, half a beat off, then returns. I feel a faint buzz in the air, a pressure change. My skin prickles.

The door to the bathroom in the suite creaks open by itself.

I stare. The door swings slowly, inch by inch, as if a draft is pushing it. There's no draft. The air is still.

"Close it," Mackenzie whispers.

I step toward it. The jade beads pulse in my palm. I reach for the handle. The door stops, then swings back, like something on the other side is playing with it. The mirror inside reflects the amber light. For a second, I see my eyes in the mirror and the pupils are full of geometric shapes, tiny spinning patterns. I blink. They're gone.

"I can't do this," I say. My voice cracks. I drop to the edge of the bed and bury my face in my hands. "I'm tired. I'm so tired."

Mackenzie sits beside me. She doesn't say anything. She just leans against my shoulder. I let her. I let the weight of another body remind me that I'm still here.

I think of my sister again, Mei, her blunt texts, her eye rolls, the way she sent me pictures of her daughter learning to ride a bike. I never flew home for that. I was in Bali, taking a brand deal for a beach coworking space. I posted a photo of my laptop on a surfboard. It got 3,000 likes.

"If I get out," I say, "I'm going to call her. I'm going to tell her I'm sorry. I'm going to go home for a while." The promise feels fragile, like a wish.

Mackenzie nods. "If we get out," she says.

We sit like that, two exhausted bodies in an expensive room, waiting for a knock that may never come.

Another knock sounds, this one sharp and urgent. It isn't the patient knock from before. This is a knock that says time is up.

"Amina?" I call.

No answer.

The door doesn't open. The lock clicks. The handle won't turn.

Mackenzie grips the doorknob and twists. Nothing. She yanks harder. The door holds. The metal is hot now, too hot. She jerks her hand back, swearing.

"It's locked," she says. Her voice is thin.

I pull the window latch. It doesn't budge. The metal feels fused. The only air in the room is the air the room gives us.

A sound comes through the wall, faint at first, then clearer. The clicking from the linen closet, amplified, as if the typing is now inside the plaster. The rhythm matches the fountain. Six, pause, six.

My phone buzzes from Amina's apron, a distant vibration that I can feel through the walls, or maybe I'm imagining it. My own pocket buzzes too, phantom vibrations in skin that has learned to expect a device there.

The room's lamps flicker. The amber light deepens. The desk by the window is no longer empty. A laptop sits there, lid open, screen glowing. I don't know when it appeared. I don't want to know.

On the screen, the password field is full. A single button glows beneath it, soft and patient. ACCEPT.

The cursor blinks in the room, not on the screen. It blinks behind my eyes.

Mackenzie stares at the laptop. "That's not your laptop," she says.

"No," I say.

The button pulses once, like a heartbeat. The fountain answers.

Outside the door, footsteps approach, soft and precise. The lock clicks again, as if someone has just secured it from the other side.

"Olivia," a voice says through the wood. It's Fatima, calm and polite. "Your call is waiting."

The laptop pings, and my own voice answers from the speakers. "I'm here," it says, in a tone I use when I'm pretending I'm fine.

I take a step toward the desk without deciding to. Mackenzie grabs my arm. Her nails dig into my skin. The jade beads in my palm are hot now, almost burning. I don't let go.

"Don't," she whispers.

The ACCEPT button pulses again. The cursor in my head blinks. The room's air feels thick, like it's waiting for a choice.

I open my mouth, and for a moment I don't know if I'm about to say yes or scream.
