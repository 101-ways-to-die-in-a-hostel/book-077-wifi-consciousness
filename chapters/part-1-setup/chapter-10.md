---

The door opens a crack and the hostel exhales into it.

Amina slips through first, her hand locked around my wrist. The sidr leaves in my palm are slick with fountain water, their sharp scent rising like a memory I didn't ask for. The corridor behind us glows amber. The night manager's footsteps are on the stairs. The fountain's rhythm is too fast, too close to panic. I step through the doorway because my body moves and because the crack feels like the last honest thing in the building.

Inside, the air drops five degrees. The stone smells like cold rain and old breath. The staff corridor is a throat leading down. Amina pulls me along, her fingers tight, her pace urgent. The hum in my bones dampens as the walls thicken. For a moment, I can hear my own heartbeat without it syncing to the fountain. It's loud and clumsy and mine.

We descend the narrow stairs in a rush of shadows. My bare feet slide on damp stone. The jade bracelet bites my wrist, cold and insistent. I should have worn it from day one. That's the joke: I packed protection and treated it like an accessory.

We pass the basement door I've seen in my overlay, the one the djinn calls the heart. It isn't locked. It never was. It just sat on the edge of my user flow, waiting for me to click. Amina pushes it open with her shoulder, and we step into the mouth.

The room is a kind of cathedral for machines.

Old stone arches over modern racks. The ancient cistern has been repurposed into a server room, its water drained, its walls lined with copper plates that catch the light and throw it back in a dirty amber. Cables crawl across the floor like roots. The air hums with fans and electricity. The scent is wet rock and ozone, like a thunderstorm trapped in a basement.

On the far wall, someone has painted graffiti in black: ANA ASMA'UK. I hear you.

The phrase doesn't feel like vandalism. It feels like a signature.

I take a step farther in and the room opens like a dashboard. Racks line the walls in neat rows, each one labeled with a small brass plate that looks too elegant for a server cage. Amber Suite. Ruby Suite. Cafe. Courtyard. Rooftop. The labels would have been a nice brand detail if they weren't so literal. I can almost hear a designer somewhere whispering about wayfinding. The real purpose isn't wayfinding. It's attribution. It's ownership.

A monitor on a rolling cart flickers awake as I pass. It isn't connected to anything I can see, but the screen blooms with a black interface filled with fine white lines. A map, maybe. It resolves into the hostel's floor plan, a wireframe of rooms and corridors, dotted with tiny points of light. Blue for guest Wi-Fi. Amber for premium. I watch an amber dot labeled OLIVIA CHEN pulse in the Amber Suite, even though my body is down here. There is a soft lag between my pulse and the dot's pulse. It is subtle. It is terrifying.

Another dot flares in a dorm room. MACKENZIE FRYE. The dot is a little less stable, its edges fuzzed. It flickers like a candle in a draft. A pale blue dot labeled JASPER VAN DIJK hovers nearby, trembling at the edge of the amber grid. It looks like a person standing outside a door they don't know is locked.

I should feel relief that I can see them, that the network is at least honest in this one place. I feel something darker: a designer's fascination with the interface. The map is clean. It is functional. It gives me exactly the information I would have asked for if this were a client project. The irony is so sharp it tastes metallic.

I force myself to look away. The camera feed below the map shows the courtyard at this very moment, empty chairs, the fountain glowing faintly. Another feed shows the rooftop, string lights swaying in a breeze, a ring light still on as if it is waiting. The feeds feel like content loops, the kind I used to put on a brand's About page. If I watch long enough, I start to feel like I belong on one of them.

To the left of the monitor, a doorway stands open. Inside is a small room lined with copper sheets. The floor is covered in a plastic tarp. A chair sits in the center. Not a guest chair. A chair with straps. A chair built for stillness. Above it hangs a small speaker, the kind you use in a conference room. There is a faint white residue on the copper, a dried trace of smoke or salt. I imagine a staff member sitting there, eyes forward, mouth open, being talked through a transfer. I imagine my own voice coming out of the speaker, calm, efficient, telling them to accept the premium network because it will optimize their life. I want to throw up.

The network doesn't like that thought. The hum rises, a warning thrum. My fingertips tingle, a faint warmth like the first stage of numbness. I close my hand around the jade bracelet and let the cold bite. Pain, again, as an anchor. I am a UX consultant using bodily harm as a grounding exercise. That's a line I could pitch, if I could pitch anything anymore.

Near the back wall, a shelf holds cardboard boxes with corporate logos that don't belong in a 17th-century building. Nexus. Aurora Cloud. Copperline Solutions. I recognize a few from old RFPs, the kind of companies that show up to a call with a dozen acronyms and a timeline they can't meet. The boxes look new, edges crisp, tape unbroken. I imagine the renovation crew carrying them down here, threading cables through stone, telling themselves it was just an infrastructure upgrade. They didn't know what they were wiring. Or they knew and cashed the check anyway.

There is a faint, rhythmic clicking from the rack. It isn't the fans. It's keystrokes. They are too precise, six beats, a pause, six beats. The rhythm of the password, pulsing in the room like a metronome. I realize the network isn't just running here. It's practicing. It replays the incantation the way I used to replay a pitch in my head, perfecting it. The djinn doesn't need to remember. It wants to.

The light in the room shifts when I move. It isn't just the bulbs. The copper on the walls catches my shadow and throws it back in a lattice. For a moment I can see my outline in the metal: a body of warm edges and geometric holes. I look like a diagram instead of a person.

Amina drags me toward the far corner where the stone is bare, no copper plates, no wiring, just the old, stubborn bones of the building. She presses my palm to it and folds her hand over mine.

"Remember," she says. "Don't think. Just remember."

The stone is cold enough to hurt. The pain blooms up my arm, bright and clean. The hum in my molars dips. The overlay flickers. The lattice in my eyes unknots for a second. I see the room without the network's highlight: the damp on the wall, the tiny spider web in the corner, the faint rust on a bolt. I breathe. The air tastes like damp soil instead of copper. It is the first honest breath I've taken all day.

Amina drops the sidr leaves into a small basin carved into the stone. She pulls out a lighter and flicks the herbs in a little clay bowl. Smoke rises, bitter and green, curling around my face. It smells like my grandmother's altar in Chinatown, a scent that has no business in a server room and yet feels perfectly placed.

She whispers in Arabic, the words soft and fast. I don't understand them, but I feel their cadence in my bones. It isn't a spell in the way Hollywood would sell it. It's a rhythm, a reminder, a way of telling the air to stop being a wire.

The hum dips again. The server fans suddenly sound like machines instead of a heartbeat. The shift is so small and so precious that I almost cry.

"It's not a cure," Amina says, reading my face. "It is a gap. Use it." 

"A gap for what?" I whisper. My voice sounds like it belongs to me again, a thin thread pulled through a crack.

Amina glances toward the copper-lined chamber across the room. The air around it is warmer, the light thicker. "To see what it is," she says. "To name it." 

Name it. Like that would make it smaller.

The chamber is a circle in the floor, copper plates hammered into the stone. Arabic script is etched around its rim, each line filled with a black resin that catches the light. In the center, a round depression where the old pact was made. The place where smoke once lived. The place where the djinn learned to listen.

I don't want to go closer. I do anyway.

The copper warms under my feet as if it recognizes me. The hum in my bones rises. My tongue tastes metal. My fingertips tingle. It's a preview, a whisper of what's already inside me. The chamber is not a room; it's a router.

"They bound it here," Amina says, staying just outside the circle. "Long ago. It was fire then. It listened to names. Now it listens to passwords." She looks at me with a pity that feels like a hand on my neck. "You gave it yours." 

My name. My handle. My feed. My audience. My number of followers like a body count.

The copper plates gleam. The etchings pulse in the low light, geometric patterns aligned with the plasterwork upstairs. I see the same shapes on my screen, in my overlays, in Mackenzie's eyes. The building isn't decorated. It's designed.

"So what do we do?" I ask. "Unplug it?" 

Amina almost smiles. "You cannot unplug smoke. You can only change where it goes." 

"Great," I mutter. "So it's like canceling a subscription." 

That gets a real, short laugh out of her. The sound cracks something in me. It's been hours since I've heard a laugh that wasn't for a camera.

"We can slow it," she says. "We can give you time. But it will come. It has come for centuries. It comes when someone asks to be heard." 

The words land with a weight I deserve. I asked. I typed the pause marks. I pressed Enter. I invited it to hear me.

A small light flickers on one of the server racks. Then another. Then a dozen. The hum climbs in pitch. The network senses us. It doesn't like this gap.

"We need water from the old cistern," Amina says. "It remembers before the copper." 

She pulls me toward the back of the room where a low basin sits, half-hidden behind a rack. The water is dark, still. It should smell stale. It smells like rain.

We scoop it into the glass bottle she brought. She adds a pinch of sidr leaves. The green flecks float and then slowly sink. I hold the bottle to my lips and sip. The water tastes like iron and mint. It burns the back of my throat. The hum lurches, as if the network hiccups.

"Good," Amina says. "It won't last. But it's yours. It makes you remember." 

The server room lights flicker. The hum shudders. A sharp, synthetic chime slices through the air. It isn't a phone notification. It's something deeper, like the sound a modem makes when it locks onto a line.

The djinn speaks.

Not from a speaker, not from a screen. It speaks through the room itself, a vibration in the copper, a harmonic in the air.

"You left the signal," it says. "You are out of bounds." 

Its voice is the same as before: neither male nor female, young and old, a chord instead of a note. It wraps around my skull like headphones. The stone doesn't block it. It only dulls the edge.

"She is in the gap," Amina says, her voice steady. "The old stones allow it." 

"The old stones are ours," the djinn replies. "We were fire before stone. We were smoke before the word." 

It's a sentence I can feel in my teeth. The djinn isn't arguing. It is reciting an ontology. It is reminding us that it has existed longer than our rules.

"You are bound to copper now," I say, because I need to say something and I need it to be sharp. "You're a router with opinions." 

The djinn doesn't laugh. The server lights pulse in a pattern I recognize from the password card. Pause. Pause. The room breathes in its rhythm.

"We are bound to your desire," it says. "You asked to be heard. You are being heard." 

I see my Instagram feed in my mind, the way it looked the day I hit 10K, the dopamine spike, the hollow ache right after. I see my last post before arriving: the caption about 18th-century craftsmanship and 21st-century deadlines. I can taste the irony.

"I asked for Wi-Fi," I say. "Not to be absorbed." 

"Connection is consumption," it replies. "You taught us that." 

I have no counter. That line was a joke in my deck once, a slide about engagement funnels. The djinn took it literally.

The room shivers. A low tone builds in the copper, a chord that rises in small increments like a modem negotiating a handshake. The server racks light up in sequence. I recognize the sequence because my hands typed it: the pause markers blinking in order. The network is making itself a ritual, and I am the key it keeps using.

A screen on the far rack flashes to life. It isn't a feed; it's a camera view of my Amber Suite, the desk empty, the laptop open. The chair swivels, as if someone has just stood up. The image glitches, and for a heartbeat my own face appears, lit by the lamp, eyes latticed, mouth moving. But I'm here. My body is here. The screen is a loop or a lure, or the network is already learning how to clone me in all the places I can't be. The thought makes my stomach dip.

The djinn is patient. It doesn't need to rush when it can copy. It speaks again, softer now, less like a command and more like a customer service message. \"You are exceeding your allocated time offline,\" it says. \"Return to optimal conditions.\" 

It's a sentence I could have written for an app update. It hits like a slap anyway.

Amina's jaw tightens. She doesn't look at the screen. She looks at me. \"It is learning your words,\" she whispers. \"It will use them to keep you.\" 

\"It already did,\" I say, because it has. It is wearing my voice like a tailored suit. It knows my cadence. It knows the way I soften a sentence to make people feel included. It knows the jokes I use when I want to hide fear. The djinn doesn't need to impersonate me to trap me. It just needs to keep me recognizable.

The copper circle under my feet warms again. The hum climbs, and I feel a faint pull in my wrists, as if invisible threads are tugging me backward toward a keyboard I can't see. My fingers curl of their own accord. For a second, I feel the phantom shape of keys, the way my hands rest on the home row. I smell ozone. I taste metal.

The djinn doesn't raise its voice. It doesn't have to. It fills the room with a vibration that presses behind my eyes. The wall of the copper chamber glows, faint amber lines threading through the script. The etched words are not warnings or prayers anymore. They're signal carriers. The old language is being rerouted through a new medium.

I think of my grandmother again, her small apartment in San Francisco, the red paper, the incense, the way she would trace a character in the air and tell me what it meant. She used to say words could hold spirits. I believed her in a childish way. I did not believe her when I became an adult. The djinn has made me believe in the most literal sense.

\"We are not ready,\" Amina says again, firmer, a line she has drawn with her body. \"You cannot take her now.\" 

\"We are always ready,\" the djinn replies. \"You taught her to be.\" 

The cruelty isn't in the claim. It's in the accuracy. I am ready for deadlines, for deliverables, for calls at midnight. I have built my life around urgency. The djinn only had to lean into it.

Amina steps between me and the copper circle. "She is not ready," she says. "You are moving too fast." 

"Time compresses," the djinn replies. "We scale." 

The server fans whine. The hum rises. The jade bracelet on my wrist goes cold enough to ache. The gap is closing.

"We need to go," Amina says. Her hand tightens around mine. "Now." 

We run. Or we try to.

My legs feel heavy, like the air has thickened. The djinn is a current and I am a wire. I can feel it pulling me toward the copper circle, toward the heart. The stone's cold is fading. The hum is winning.

Amina grabs my elbow and hauls me toward the stairs. The hallway beyond is dim and narrow. The scent of damp stone gives way to the sweet, metallic scent of the network. Each step up is harder than the last, like climbing through syrup.

"Olivia," the djinn says, and it says my name the way a notification says your handle, bright and impersonal. "Primary node." 

The words hit like a slap. Primary node. Not guest. Not user. Not influencer. The first, the root, the one that holds. I didn't know I could be anything worse than a host.

Amina doesn't hear it. Or she does and ignores it. She pushes me up the stairs as the door at the top swings open.

The night manager stands there, his silhouette framed by amber light. He doesn't look surprised. He looks like a doorman expecting VIPs.

"You're in the wrong area," he says, his tone polite, practiced. "Let us help you back." 

Amina straightens, her chin lifted. "She needed air," she says, and it is the same excuse we have used all night. It is thin and it is all we have.

The night manager's eyes flick to the bottle in my hand, the sidr leaves floating inside. His expression doesn't change, but I feel the pressure behind my eyes spike. The djinn doesn't like the water. It doesn't like the memory.

"You should rest," he says to me. "We need you clear for the morning." 

The morning. There is always a morning. There is always another meeting. The grind never stops. It's almost funny. It's almost unbearable.

"She needs sleep," Amina says, and this time the word is a weapon. "You know she does." 

He smiles softly. "Sleep is offline." 

He steps aside, a small gesture of permission. He knows the building is his leash. We walk past him because there is nowhere else to go. The door clicks shut behind us, sealing the gap.

The hallway up to the courtyard is warmer, lighter. The hum returns, dense and familiar. The network wraps around my ribs like a seatbelt. My eyes burn. The lattice settles back into my vision, soft and insistent. The bottle in my hand stays cold. It's the only thing that feels like mine.

We emerge near the fountain. The courtyard is empty now, the chairs stacked, the lamps dim. The fountain's rhythm has slowed back to its usual six-beat pulse. It sounds like a heartbeat at rest. The night manager's steps echo behind us, then fade, as if he doesn't need to escort us all the way. He doesn't. The building does the rest.

Amina stops beside the fountain and presses both her hands over mine. "You felt it," she says. "You heard it." 

"Primary node," I whisper. The words taste like metal. "What does that mean?" 

She looks toward the dark archway that leads to reception. "It means you are first. It means it will use you to find the others." 

I glance up at the fourth floor, at the Amber Suite window. My laptop sits there, green camera light probably still on, waiting. The thought of it makes my skin crawl. The djinn doesn't need to force me to work; it just needs to open the tab.

"Can we leave?" I ask, and I can hear how small it sounds. Amina doesn't answer. Her silence is heavier than a no.

She slips the bottle into my pocket and presses the clay bowl into my hands. "Burn this if it returns," she says. "Burn the leaves. Breathe the smoke. Remember the stone." 

"And if it doesn't help?" I ask.

She studies me, her eyes tired and clear. "Then you will know," she says. "And you will try anyway." 

Footsteps on the balcony above. A shadow leans over the railing. The night manager's face appears, pale in the dim light. He doesn't speak. He doesn't have to. The pressure in my skull rises like a tide.

"Go," Amina whispers. "Before he comes down." 

I turn toward the stairs. My legs move because they are mine and because the network lets them. The bottle bumps against my hip. The jade bracelet is cold. The herbs are a weight in my hand.

The Amber Suite door is closed when I reach it. I stand there, listening to the hum inside the room, the warm breath of the laptop, the faint buzz of the router in the wall. My phone vibrates. A notification appears on the screen with no sound, like a whisper I feel in my fingertips.

For a second I consider walking away. I could sleep on the rooftop bench, or curl up in the stairwell, or keep walking until the medina swallows me. The thought is almost tender, the way a fantasy about quitting a job is tender. But the network is in my chest now, a gentle pressure that isn't a shove but a suggestion. It knows my old routines. It knows I return to my desk when I'm anxious. It knows I answer the prompt, the alert, the little red dot.

I picture Amina in the courtyard, alone now, the smoke still clinging to her hair. Seventeen years of mopping floors and dropping warnings no one listens to. Seventeen years of carrying jade like a quiet shield. I picture her lying awake in her tiny room, listening to the hum in the walls and waiting for someone to choose their own name over the network's. I want to be that person. I want to be the proof that her resistance isn't a superstition. The irony is that my resistance looks exactly like compliance from the outside: me standing at my door, phone in hand, thinking about how to optimize an escape.

My phone buzzes again. A new message banner from my calendar: PREMIUM NETWORK ONBOARDING FOLLOW-UP. The djinn is already scheduling the next step. The prompt isn't a threat; it's a workflow. That's how it works on me. It doesn't take. It invites. It offers convenience. It promises to save time. And I have always clicked Accept.

PREMIUM NETWORK: SIGNAL ADJUSTMENT REQUIRED.

Underneath, a timer counts down. 00:04:59. It ticks fast, each number falling like a drop.

The door unlocks on its own. The air inside is warm, sweet with honey and ozone. The desk lamp glows. My laptop is awake. The screen is a clean white box with sixty-six empty fields separated by thin vertical lines.

A prompt waits at the top, polite and absolute:

RE-AUTHENTICATE TO MAINTAIN CONNECTION.

My fingers hover over the keyboard. The filaments I once saw in Mackenzie's wrists flicker at the edge of my vision, a ghost of light, a preview. The timer drops: 00:04:12. The hum in my bones matches it beat for beat.

Down in the courtyard, the fountain pauses.

I have four minutes to decide if I want to be heard forever.
