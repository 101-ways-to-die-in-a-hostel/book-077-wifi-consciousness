---

Four minutes is an absurd amount of time to decide the rest of your life.

The countdown sits in the corner of my screen like a hovering HR note. 00:03:52, 00:03:51, 00:03:50. The white box with sixty-six empty fields waits beneath it, perfectly aligned, perfectly silent, the thin vertical lines dividing each group of characters like a guided meditation for people who breathe in deadlines.

I stand in the doorway and do the math I always do. If I walk away now, I lose the client, the retainer, the project. If I lose the project, I lose the quarter's momentum. If I lose the momentum, my engagement drops, my algorithm placement slips, my brand becomes just another feed lost in a scroll of other people's rattan chairs and cappuccinos. The world doesn't end, but my world does. The network knows this. The network knows I believe it.

The door clicks behind me without being touched. The amber light in the room softens the corners of everything, making the desk look like a curated product shot. The laptop's glow is a clean rectangle of white. The air smells of honey and ozone, and there is a thin metallic taste at the back of my throat like I've been holding a coin under my tongue.

I have one minute and thirty seconds to decide whether I am absurd or alive.

The bottle in my pocket bumps my hip when I move, the cold glass a small anchor. The water from the cistern is still in there, darker now, a faint green tint from the sidr leaves. I can almost feel Amina's fingers over mine, the way she pressed the clay bowl into my hands, the way she told me to remember. I should pour it over the keyboard. I should drink it and run. Instead I stand in a room that smells like a warm circuit board and act like I'm waiting for a coffee to cool.

In my head, I am negotiating with a client who doesn't exist. "We need a little more time," I tell the room. "We need to push the launch." The room doesn't answer. It doesn't need to. The timer doesn't care about my soft skills.

I step to the desk and pull the password card from the side pocket of my bag. It is heavy, almost luxurious, the kind of thick stock a brand uses when it wants you to feel valued. There is no logo, no network name, just a string of characters in black ink, broken into groups by the same thin vertical lines. Each line is carefully spaced, as if someone designed it with a ruler and a single intention.

I have stared at this card before, when Youssef handed it to me with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "It's... consuming," he said, then laughed as if it were a joke, as if English was a coat he could shrug off. I called it lost in translation and slid the card into my wallet like it was a VIP pass to a rooftop bar. I even texted my group chat: "Premium Wi-Fi requires a sorcery-level password." They replied with flame emojis and asked for the hostel name.

Now the card feels different. The lines are a little too deliberate. The characters are a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols that look like they belong in another alphabet. Some of them might actually be another alphabet. The last group ends with a curve that isn't a letter I know. It looks like a hook or a flame. It makes my stomach twist. Each group has a tiny dot above it, almost invisible unless I tilt the card into the light. The dot is a design element or a ritual mark. I choose design element.

"It's just security," I tell myself. "Enterprise-grade. Probably required by GDPR." It is an explanation that doesn't fit and I pull it over the moment anyway, a sweater in a cold room.

00:02:31.

I sit. The chair is warm as if someone else was just here. The keyboard is warmer still. I press my fingertips to it and feel heat rise through the plastic. My mind spins up a diagnostic: fans clogged, CPU throttling, maybe a faulty USB-C adapter. I am a UX consultant who has Googled the wrong things for too many years and convinced herself it counts as IT. The heat is steady, not the kind that spikes and cools. It feels almost intentional, the way a mug warmer feels intentional.

I place the card next to the trackpad and set my hands on the home row. I read the first group of characters and type them. I pause at the first vertical line because the line tells me to pause, because the card tells me to pause, because the timer does not. The room seems to hold its breath with me. The desk lamp flickers once, so faint I could call it my eyes. I glance at the window. The courtyard is a quiet square of darkness and pale tile. The fountain glints, the water still for a beat too long before it resumes.

Second group. Pause. The fountain in the courtyard below shifts its rhythm, a subtle stumble like a drum missing a beat.

Third group. Pause. The light shifts again. I tell myself it is the old wiring, the kind that hums in a building this ancient, and that the hum in my bones is just sleep deprivation.

Fourth group. Pause. I look at the timer and swear under my breath, because there are still more characters than seconds. The card is fifty percent password, fifty percent ritual. It is ridiculous. It is necessary. The pause markers were explained as a security measure, "to prevent brute force," Fatima said when she handed me the card. That explanation made sense and didn't make sense at all. You don't slow down security; you automate it. You don't make a password longer than a page unless you want someone to stop and do it on purpose.

Fifth group. Pause. The air in the room warms by a degree. My skin prickles. I type faster.

By the time I reach the final curve-flame symbol, my wrists are sweating. My tongue tastes copper. My phone vibrates once on the desk, a sympathetic shiver, as if it too feels the pressure.

I hit Enter.

The network connects with a chime that is not from my laptop. It blooms through the walls and the floor, a soft chord that feels like a breath entering my chest. The Wi-Fi icon jumps to seven bars, a number my phone doesn't actually have. It looks wrong and perfect at the same time. The air pressure shifts a fraction, like a plane leveling out. I inhale and the smell of honey deepens.

The network name appears in the corner of the screen in a script I can't read: أنا أسمعك. Underneath it, in small English text, "I hear you." A private joke. A threat. A translation glitch. I choose glitch. I choose joke. I choose to not feel the way my skin tightened at the sight of it.

"Okay," I whisper, as if I'm talking to a stubborn piece of software. "Connected. Happy?" The words bounce in the room and die softly against the plaster. No response. Just the hum, a quiet yes.

The timer disappears. The white box folds into itself, and my desktop is back, neat, familiar, full of deliverables. I open my slide deck. It loads instantly. A bandwidth test shows 872 Mbps down, 411 up. I take a screenshot out of habit. It is the best internet I've ever had.

Something in me relaxes. It is horrifying how quickly relief can erase dread.

---

The courtyard smells like mint and damp stone and the faint, sweet trace of ozone that clings to the air around the fountain. Dawn turns the sky pale gold, soft enough to be forgiving. I haven't slept. I am caffeinated and connected, which is a version of sleep I have been practicing for years. I scroll through my notifications as I walk, clearing the red dots like they are crumbs on a table. A new comment on my last post: "Your energy has shifted. In a good way?" I ignore it and like a photo of a ceramic bowl from someone I don't remember following.

The cafe is already open. A line of laptops glows on the long wooden table, each one a small altar. The guests are hunched in their chairs, faces lit blue, fingers moving in quick, purposeful bursts. From the outside it would look like industry. From inside, it feels like worship.

I order mint tea and a croissant and take them outside. My phone auto-connects to the premium network without asking. The signal bars are still at seven. I am the only person in the courtyard with seven bars. That should feel exclusive. It feels isolating. The barista gives me an extra napkin and a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes. It is the same kind of smile Fatima wears. I decide it's hospitality and not something else.

Mackenzie is already there, legs tucked under her on a bench, a camera balanced on a tiny tripod in front of her. She waves when she sees me, too bright for the hour. Her feed is all pastel filters and candid shots, a kind of effortless that takes effort.

"Hey, Olivia," she says. "You were up late. I saw your light on when I went to bed." The line could be friendly or surveillance. In this building, it's both.

"Client call in three hours," I say, because that's my version of hello. "You?

"Content deadline," she says, and laughs. "I have to post two reels before noon or my agent texts me in all caps. We are all the same.

"Do you ever feel like the internet is a needy pet?" I ask. "Like if you don't feed it on time it eats your furniture?" I hear my own voice and it sounds tired in a way I can hear through the laugh.

She grins. "That's why I chose this hostel. Everyone says the Wi-Fi is magical." She wiggles her fingers, as if she is casting a spell. "No glitches, no buffering. It's like it reads your mind.

"I heard that too." The words come out dry. My tongue still tastes metal. I take a sip of tea to wash it away.

The mint is too sweet. It's the kind of sugar you can feel in your teeth. The warmth settles in my chest, and beneath it I can still feel the faint hum, a low, steady frequency that seems to live behind my sternum. It wasn't there yesterday. Or it was and I didn't notice because the city has a thousand sounds at once.

Amina crosses the courtyard with a tray of bread and a kettle. She keeps her eyes down. When she passes me, I catch the edge of her sleeve and see the jade beads at her wrist, green against her brown skin. She doesn't look at me. She doesn't need to. The warning is already in my bones.

"Morning, Amina," I say, and my voice is careful, the way you speak when you're sorry and don't want to admit it. She pauses, just long enough for the air between us to thicken, then continues on. Her silence feels like a judgement and a plea.

"Who's that?" Mackenzie asks, nodding toward her.

"Cleaner," I say. The word sounds small and wrong. "She... knows things.

"About ghosts?" Mackenzie grins and lifts her phone for a quick shot of the fountain. "I would die for a haunting right now. Imagine the engagement.

"No," I say, and can't find the joke fast enough. "Not ghosts.

"Okay, ominous," she says, and returns to her screen, fingers tapping out a caption. "Anyway, I have to tell you something. Your post last night? The one with the password card? It got saved a ton. People love the mystery." She swivels the camera on the tripod toward me and does a quick pan, catching the fountain, the tiles, the croissant like it was staged. "Hold that mug up," she says. "The light is perfect."

I blink. "What post?"

She raises an eyebrow. "The story. The close-up of the card. You wrote 'the Wi-Fi here requires a master key.' It was so on-brand.

My stomach shifts. I didn't post a story. I didn't even take a photo. I could have, sure, the card looks good on the warm wood with a candle and a mint tea in frame, but I didn't. I was in the basement. I was on the stairs. I was running. I was not curating. Still, when she pulls up the story on her phone, there it is: my hand, the card, the vertical lines, the caption in my usual font. The angle is flattering. The image has the kind of quiet, soft grain I only get when I use my camera app's manual settings. I don't remember taking it. I don't remember not taking it.

"Must have been scheduled," I say, because the alternative is not a thing I can say out loud. I have auto-posts queued for the week. I am the kind of person who schedules their spontaneity. The line lands with an unpleasant thud inside me, like a truth that isn't supposed to be said in company.

Mackenzie nods as if that explains everything. "Smart. I need to do that. Keep the algorithm fed while you're sleeping. Or, you know, not sleeping.

"Exactly," I say. The hum under my ribs agrees.

A notification pops up on my phone: PREMIUM NETWORK QUALITY REPORT. A green checkmark. "Connection optimal. Latency: 2ms. Stability: 99.9%." Below, a button: SHARE RESULTS. Under that, a line of text: "Upgrade identified. Thank you for your participation." Participation in what, exactly, is not specified.

I should be unsettled. Instead, I feel an involuntary surge of satisfaction. Even my Wi-Fi is outperforming.

I hit dismiss. The button lingers for a beat before it fades, like it wanted me to share. Like it wants to be seen.

The call to prayer echoes over the courtyard, a low, rolling sound that makes the fountain's rhythm shift again. The fountain syncs to it for a moment, then returns to its steady beat. My body does the same. The line between me and the building feels thinner than it should. I chalk it up to sleep deprivation and caffeine. I am good at excuses. A pigeon lands on the fountain's edge, drinks, and flies off. The water does not ripple where it drank. It should. I watch for too long, then look away.

I leave Mackenzie to her captions and take the long way back to my room, looping through the quiet corridors to stretch my legs and justify the time. The tiles are cool under my bare feet, the plasterwork casting shadows like a lattice across the walls. The hum follows me, subtle but constant, a tone you only notice when it stops. It doesn't stop.

In the second-floor common area, two backpackers sit across from each other with laptops open and headphones in, their hands moving in near-perfect sync. Their screens reflect the same amber hue. They don't speak. They don't glance up. I walk past and their eyes don't follow me. It should be a relief. It feels like being unseen.

At the staff corridor, the door marked خاص is cracked open. I catch a sliver of darkness and the faint smell of copper. The bottle in my pocket chills my fingers when I touch it, the glass sweating. I tell myself I should pour it out, not carry it like a charm. I keep it anyway. The jade bracelet sits cold on my wrist, a tiny weight that makes every movement a little more deliberate.

Fatima appears near the stairwell as if summoned by my glance. Her smile is practiced and smooth, and there is no fatigue in her posture despite the early hour. "Miss Chen," she says. "Did the connection resolve?"

"Perfectly," I say, and it is the truth in the same way most of my captions are true. "Better than home, honestly."

She nods, pleased. "We are happy to provide for our guests."

There is a second where I almost tell her about the story I didn't post, the amber dot, the camera light. The confession sits on my tongue like a pebble. I swallow it with the last of the mint tea instead. "Thank you," I say. "It's been... great."

Her eyes flick to the jade beads. She doesn't comment. Her smile doesn't change. "Enjoy your stay," she says, and I walk upstairs wondering when my stay started to look like something else.

By the time I return to the Amber Suite, the sun has lifted over the roofline. The room is golden, the patterns in the plasterwork sharp in the light. The geometric shapes cast shadows on my desk that look like code blocks, little windows of darkness that frame my laptop. I set the mint tea down on a coaster and notice the ring it leaves, a perfect circle within a square of wood. Everything here wants to be a design system.

My calendar is a stack of alerts. My client call is in thirty minutes. I set up my ring light on a chair, angle it just enough to hide the bags under my eyes. I push the laptop camera slightly higher to avoid the view of the courtyard, where the fountain is now catching the sunlight like a lens flare.

The premium network reconnects before I even open my laptop. The Wi-Fi symbol appears on my phone without me tapping anything. It feels too eager. It feels like the network has learned my patterns. It has. That is the point of every product I have ever helped design.

I open my slide deck. The first slide is a photo of the old riad tilework with my client's logo overlaid. It looked clever when I built it at 2 A.M. It looks like an offering now. I almost swap it out for something more neutral, but the aesthetic is why they hired me. The aesthetic is why I'm here. The aesthetic is a kind of spell too.

The laptop hums. The heat from the keyboard rises, a slow, comforting warmth like a heating pad. I rest my wrists on the edge and feel it seep into my skin. It is almost pleasant. I tell myself it's just a new battery, or the old wiring in the wall, or the way the room traps heat. It's always the old wiring, the old walls, the old city. Anything but the thing it feels like.

A small icon appears in the corner of the screen. A simple amber dot with a thin ring around it, pulsing. A tooltip pops up: PRIMARY NODE STATUS: INITIALIZING.

I stare at it. I blink. The tooltip disappears.

"Okay," I say to the empty room. "That's not funny.

I reopen the network settings. No tooltip. No dot. Just a clean list of Wi-Fi names. The premium network sits at the top in its Arabic script, locked, secure, saved.

It was probably a glitch. A cached notification. A translation error. My brain making patterns out of fear.

I could go downstairs and ask Fatima, but that would be like walking into a boutique hotel and asking the concierge if the wallpaper was cursed. You don't. You leave a review later. You bury it in a paragraph about the towels.

I run a bandwidth test again. 879 Mbps. Latency 2ms. The numbers are absurd. The numbers are beautiful. The numbers keep me in my chair.

My laptop camera light turns on. I haven't opened the video call yet.

I click the camera icon. The light stays on. The preview window is black for half a second, then my face appears. My eyes are tired, my bun has given up, my lipstick is a little too bold for a Monday morning. The ring light catches the geometric pattern on the wall behind me, and for a moment it looks like the pattern is moving, rotating very slowly in the periphery.

I open the privacy settings out of habit. Camera access is toggled on for the browser, for the call software, for an app I don't recognize: Premium Network Utility. I do not remember installing it. I toggle it off. The light stays on. I toggle it on again. The light stays on. There is no error message. There is no warning. It is the smoothest kind of disobedience, the kind you only notice when you ask for permission and don't get an answer.

I unplug the external webcam and plug it back in. The light on the laptop camera dims, then flares. The preview stutters, freezes on a frame where my smile is mid-broken, then resumes. For a second, the room behind me looks wrong, as if the geometry has shifted a few degrees. I blink and it snaps back. Jetlag, I tell myself. This is what no sleep does. This is what too much screen time does. This is what Marrakech light does when it slants in from the east.

I blink hard. The pattern stays still. It was my eyes. It was my lack of sleep.

My phone buzzes. A message from my client: "On in 5. Can't wait to see the new flow."

I answer with a thumbs-up emoji because it's faster than words and less honest than anything I could say. My hand shakes slightly when I set the phone down. I pretend it's caffeine. I put the shaking on the list of fixable things.

The call timer counts down. I rehearse the opening lines in my head, the ones I always use. "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for your time. I want to walk you through a user journey that reduces friction and increases retention by 26%." It is a script that has worked in a dozen boardrooms. It will work here too. It has to. My tongue feels numb when I practice the words. The metallic taste is back, stronger now, like I bit the edge of a battery.

The amber dot appears again. It pulses once, twice, then fades. The room feels a fraction warmer. The hum in the walls grows almost imperceptibly louder, as if the building is leaning closer to listen.

I close my eyes and breathe in the smell of copper and tea and the faint scent of sidr leaves still clinging to my hoodie from the basement. The smell is a reminder. The reminder is inconvenient.

"It's just Wi-Fi," I say. It is a sentence I have said to myself a hundred times in a hundred places. It has always been true.

The call begins. My face appears on the screen, framed, lit, optimized. Their faces pop up in a row. They smile. I smile. The network is perfect, the audio crisp, the video smooth, the connection so stable it feels like a lie.

As I start to speak, the fountain in the courtyard below pauses for one heartbeat, then resumes.

I do not look out the window. I do not mention it. I do not let my voice catch.

I deliver the presentation. I sell the story. I do what I always do: I translate human desire into interface logic, and I call it empathy. The deck flows faster than usual. My mouth says the right words at the right times with almost no effort. The questions from the client feel like prompts I've answered before, even though this is a new product. I am in a groove so smooth it feels like I'm being carried.

Somewhere under my ribs, a pulse answers the fountain's rhythm, as if my body has learned a new metronome.

When the client says, "This is incredible," I feel the warmth at my wrists deepen, and for a split second I imagine thin amber threads sliding out from beneath my skin, searching for a place to attach.

I blink and the image is gone. The client is still smiling. The connection is still strong.

I tell myself it was nerves.

The amber dot appears once more in the corner of my screen, larger now, and I pretend I don't see it.
