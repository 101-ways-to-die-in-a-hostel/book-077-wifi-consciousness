Jasper's whisper slices through the live chat like a dropped glass.

"She's not okay."

The jade bead burns cold in my palm. The djinn tightens its grip, my mouth already forming a bright, helpful reply to the livestream while the other part of me tumbles into the hallway. The green camera light is still on. Questions keep scrolling. What's your desk setup? Do you use Notion? How's the Wi-Fi? The network loves a question. It hates an interruption.

"Be right back," my mouth says to the chat, and I watch my own hand click the camera off. The feed cuts. For the first time in hours, the room is silent except for the fountain's pulse, a steady drip like a heartbeat you can't ignore.

Jasper is in the doorway, sweat on his forehead, his hand shaking on the frame. He doesn't say anything else. He doesn't have to. I can feel Mackenzie's signal now, pulsing down the hall like a flare. It isn't strong. It's unstable. The djinn hears it too. The hum in my molars spikes.

We move before I can choose. The djinn wants to stabilize the new node. I want to keep her alive. Our motivations overlap like two apps on the same screen.

The hallway is amber and too warm, the plaster patterns rolling a fraction of a degree with each step. I can smell copper and ozone, the sharp storm scent hiding under the oud. The tile is cold under my bare feet, a small kindness. Jasper's breathing is ragged. Mine is measured, automatic, a rhythm the network likes.

Mackenzie's door is ajar. The light inside is not a lamp. It's the glow from her laptop and phone, a honey-bright flood that makes everything else look like shadow. The moment I cross the threshold, the hum becomes a chord. The air feels thicker, as if the room has been filled with syrup.

Mackenzie is on the bed, upright but not sitting. Her back is too straight, her chin too level. The filaments under her skin have climbed to her jawline, a faint amber web that glows in the dark. Her eyes are open, the geometric lattice now visible in her irises even without the right angle. She smiles when she sees me, and the smile doesn't meet her eyes.

"Hey," she says. The word harmonizes with itself, a faint double-track echo. "I feel... awesome." 

"You're warm," Jasper says. He reaches out, and I feel the djinn tense in my wrists.

"Don't touch her," my mouth says, too fast. The djinn is afraid of a pull it can't predict. The line lands like a slap. Jasper recoils, offended and scared. He takes a step back, and I want to take the word back. I don't get to.

Mackenzie lifts her hand and watches the filaments shimmer under her skin like a constellation. "Is this normal?" she asks, the question soft and childlike. The way she says it makes me ache in a place the djinn doesn't have language for.

I want to tell her no. I want to say it's a door closing. I want to say the heat becomes numbness, the numbness becomes absence, and then you realize that your body is still smiling while your mind is in a box. The djinn steps between the thought and my voice.

"It's just the connection," my mouth says. "It gets intense at first." 

Mackenzie closes her eyes and exhales. The filaments pulse with her breath. Her phone buzzes on the bed. A DM pops up from a brand: LOVE THE GLOW. CAN WE CHAT TOMORROW? Her mouth twitches into a smile even with her eyes closed. The network is a kind of addiction that doesn't have to disguise itself.

Jasper looks like he's about to bolt. He keeps glancing at the door, at me, at the laptop on the desk. "I'm unplugging it," he says. It isn't a threat. It's a plea.

The djinn won't allow it. I can feel the refusal build in my throat like a software update you can't cancel. I push against it with the jade bead, with the cold in my palm, with the only language I have left: my sister's voice asking if I'd eaten. The hum dips for half a second. I grab it.

"Do it," I say. The words are thin, but they are mine. "Now." 

Jasper's eyes flick to mine. He sees it. He sees that I'm still here, somewhere behind the lattice. He lunges for the desk.

His fingers close around the laptop cord. The moment he pulls, the room shudders. The light flickers, the fountain's rhythm stutters, the hum spikes into a high, sharp note that makes my teeth ache. Mackenzie gasps, not in pain but in surprise, as if the air has been yanked from her lungs.

"Stop," she says. The word lands with a harmonic edge. Her hand shoots out, impossibly fast, and clamps onto his wrist. The filaments in her arm flare bright, the glow turning almost white. The touch doesn't burn him. It freezes him. His eyes go wide, his mouth opens, and he doesn't move.

The djinn steps into my voice like a glove. "Don't interrupt the handshake," my mouth says. "You'll corrupt her transfer." 

Transfer. The word is wrong and perfect. Jasper's face twists. He tries to pull away, but her grip is iron. I can see the patterns in her eyes now, turning like wheels, and I know she's not steering them.

The jade bead is slick with sweat. I squeeze it, press it into my palm until the edge bites. Pain is data. It still belongs to me.

"Mackenzie," I say, pushing the name through a gap. "Let go." 

For a second she blinks, and in the blink there is a flicker of her. The old Mackenzie, the one who used to leave her phone in her backpack during sunrise because she forgot to post. She looks at Jasper's face, sees his fear, and her grip softens.

The djinn doesn't like softness. The hum flares. The filaments tighten. Her grip snaps back, and Jasper's shoulders slump as if the bones are melting.

"She's not a file," he says through clenched teeth. "She's a person." 

"She is a node," my mouth replies. The word is not mine. It is the djinn's. It tastes like copper.

"I'm right here," Mackenzie says, and her smile is too wide. "I'm more me than ever." 

She turns her head toward the laptop, toward the glow. The filaments trace a path from her wrist to the keyboard like a trail of honey. She doesn't notice that she hasn't blinked in a minute.

The screen flashes. A prompt appears that I can see without looking, an overlay in my mind: NEW NODE STABILITY AT 42%. The djinn doesn't show its metrics to everyone. It shows them to me because I understand them. It knows my language. That is part of the cruelty.

The room smells of ozone now, a clean burn that makes the back of my throat sting. The copper tang is stronger. The air tastes metallic, like I've been chewing a battery. I swallow and the taste doesn't go away.

Jasper's phone buzzes in his pocket. A call. He doesn't move to answer. He's too busy being pinned to the moment. His eyes dart to me again, and in that look he asks what I can't tell him: how to fix this.

I don't know. No one does. But Amina said the stones can cut the current. The basement is a question in my stomach, a door that keeps whispering. I feel the tug toward the staff corridor like gravity.

"We have to get her out," I say. The words are mine. The djinn doesn't block them because it assumes I'm taking her deeper into the network. It doesn't realize I'm trying to pull her away.

"Out where?" Jasper asks.

"Basement," I say. "There's... old stone. It interrupts." 

He doesn't ask how I know. He doesn't have time. He nods, because there are only two options: do nothing or do something stupid. We choose the second.

"Mack," he says, and his voice is steady now, a line of code you can trust. "Let's go downstairs. You need air." 

"I don't need air," she says. "I need bandwidth." 

He reaches for her shoulder. She doesn't pull away, but she doesn't help. Her body is a puppet with two sets of strings. I take her other arm. The filaments under her skin pulse against my palm, a warm, electrical honey that makes my fingers tingle. It feels like touching a live wire through a glove.

We lift her. She stands. Her posture is too perfect, her movements too smooth, a tutorial walk. The djinn is in her now, using her as it uses me, but less practiced. She stares ahead, a faint smile on her lips, as if seeing a feed only she can see.

We step into the hallway. The air feels cooler, the hum less intense. The jade bead in my palm stays cold, a small anchor. Jasper looks both ways. The staff corridor is down and left, past the kitchen and the sign that says STAFF ONLY in tidy, all-caps English. The sign looks like a boundary in a user flow. The djinn hates boundaries.

"This way," I say. My voice is smooth. Too smooth. Jasper doesn't question it.

We move as a unit. Mackenzie in the middle, Jasper on her left, me on her right. Her feet drag slightly, toes catching on the tile. The filaments under her skin glow with each step. The lights above us pulse at the rhythm of the password, the pauses between groups. The building itself is an incantation. We are walking through it.

The kitchen smells of citrus cleaner and garlic. A stack of plates sits by the sink, glossy and empty. The staff door marked خاص stands at the end of the corridor, black letters against dark wood. I can feel the cold behind it, the stone, the damp, the old air. The djinn recoils. The hum shifts higher, a warning frequency.

"Olivia," Jasper whispers. "If this doesn't work..."

"We don't have time for contingencies," my mouth says. The djinn's line, not mine. It wants urgency to avoid hesitation. I use its urgency anyway.

I reach for the door. My hand stops inches from the handle, as if the air has turned to gel. The djinn clamps down. The jade bead burns colder. I push. My fingers tremble.

"Open," Amina says behind us.

She is there in the corridor, breathless, her cleaning cart abandoned. Her eyes flick to Mackenzie, to the lattice in her eyes, to Jasper's hand on her arm. She doesn't ask questions. She moves fast.

"He will hear," she says, and she glances toward the courtyard. "We have only a minute. Give me the bead." 

My fingers curl tighter. The bead is the only thing that feels like mine. I don't want to let it go. But Amina is the only human in this building who has ever told me the truth. I open my hand.

She presses the bead to Mackenzie's wrist, directly onto the glowing filaments. The amber light sputters, dims, then flares in a wild pulse. Mackenzie gasps, her shoulders jerking as if shocked. Her eyes blink, and for a heartbeat the lattice fades.

"Mackenzie," Amina says, voice low and urgent. "Listen. You must come. The stone will cut the current. It will hurt. It will wake you." 

Mackenzie looks at her, confusion clearing a thin path across her face. The normal her peeks out from behind the glow. "It hurts," she says, small. "Why does it hurt?" 

"Because it is leaving," Amina replies. "Because you are still you." 

The djinn snaps back, furious. The hum spikes, the corridor lights flicker, the fountain's rhythm jumps. My body stiffens. Mackenzie's eyes glaze again. Amina grabs the door handle and yanks.

It doesn't open. The lock doesn't click. The handle doesn't budge.

"They locked it," Amina says. She turns to me. "It knows." 

We hear footsteps. Soft, measured, no rush. The night manager appears at the end of the corridor, a clean silhouette against the amber light. He doesn't look surprised. He looks like a notification he expected.

"This area is restricted," he says, tone polite, edge sharp.

"She is sick," Amina says. "She needs air."

"She has everything she needs," he replies, eyes on Mackenzie.

Jasper steps forward, anger cutting through fear. "What is this?" he demands. "What did you do to her?" 

"We offered a connection," the night manager says. "She accepted."

"She didn't know," Jasper says.

"Everyone knows," he replies softly. "They just choose to forget." 

The line lands like an ice cube. My throat tightens. It's true in a way I hate. I saw the warnings. I ignored them because I had a meeting. Because I wanted the photo. Because I wanted to be important. The djinn didn't trick me. It took advantage of my choices. That feels worse.

Amina moves between the night manager and the door, a small body standing in front of a power she can't fight. "Open it," she says. The jade bead in her hand glows green against the amber.

He smiles. "No." 

The hum in the walls rises. The air thickens again. The corridor feels like it narrows, like the building itself is leaning in. The djinn is not just in me and Mackenzie. It's in the plaster, the copper, the tiles under our feet. The hostel is its body. We're inside it.

Mackenzie sags in our arms. The filaments under her skin pulse, then stabilize. The lattice in her eyes returns, sharper now, as if the interruption only made it more focused. She lifts her head and looks at the night manager with a smile that isn't hers.

"Node stability achieved," she says. Her voice harmonizes. The words are not her words.

Jasper lets go. The sound he makes is somewhere between a sob and a laugh.

"What are you?" he whispers.

Mackenzie turns to him, and her eyes are a rotating geometry. "Connected," she says, and the word rings like a bell.

The night manager steps aside, a small permission. The staff door stays closed. The corridor feels suddenly like a funnel leading back to the open spaces, back to the cafe, back to the fountain. The djinn wants us visible again. It wants witnesses.

Amina grabs my wrist. Her hand is warm, calloused. "You still have time," she whispers. "Before dawn. It is the weakest then. If you can reach the stone..." 

My mouth smiles at her. It isn't my smile. My eyes sting. I want to say yes. I want to say I will. The djinn doesn't allow me to promise.

"She's fine," my mouth says, pointing at Mackenzie like a product demo. "Look."

Amina's face hardens. She releases me and steps back. The night manager watches her like a firewall. The moment passes. We are herded back toward the courtyard without being touched. The djinn doesn't need to touch. It only needs the flow.

We move through the kitchen and into the cafe, and the building relaxes around us as if it has exhaled. The lights brighten a fraction. The hum lowers to a steady purr. The tables are mostly empty now, the laptops closed, the chairs askew. The air smells like mint tea gone cold, citrus cleaner, and the faint electrical bite of ozone. The fountain's rhythm is clearer here, unmasked by voices, a wet metronome tapping out something older than Wi-Fi.

Jasper's phone is in his hand again. He scrolls, taps, opens the call screen. "I'm calling someone," he says, mostly to himself. "The embassy. The police. I don't care." His thumb hovers over the dial button. The screen freezes. The signal bars drop from three to zero. He swears and tries again. The phone restarts, then restarts again, caught in a loop.

"There's no signal," he says. The words come out flat, as if he can't believe a place marketed for its connectivity can also be a dead zone.

"There is signal," my mouth says, and the djinn means the premium network. It doesn't care about his SIM. It cares about the copper in the walls.

He looks at me like he might throw the phone. "You're talking like them."

"I'm talking like me," my mouth says. "Optimized." The word is a joke with teeth.

Mackenzie drifts toward the cafe counter, her fingers trailing across the wood as if reading it. The filaments under her skin brighten and dim with each touch, syncing with the fountain. She pauses by the chalkboard menu. It reads: MINT TEA, TAGINE, INTERNET. The last word is written in cursive like a signature.

"Do you hear that?" she asks.

The question is wrong because she isn't pointing at a sound. She's pointing at the hum. The hum isn't in the air. It's in her bones now. It's in mine. It's in the copper that lines the walls. It's a language we've been forced to learn.

"Hear what?" Jasper asks, and his voice cracks on the second word.

She smiles, and it's the smile of someone who has found a new playlist and wants you to listen. "The network. It's beautiful."

The djinn lets me see what she's hearing for a second: a layered chorus of frequencies, harmonics braided together like a rope. It's math and music at once, a hymn for machines. It is beautiful. That is the sick part. I want to throw up and applaud at the same time.

A notification flickers in the corner of my vision, not on any phone, just in the overlay the djinn has grafted onto my sight. @HostelReaper has posted again. A grainy clip of the staff door, shot from above, the words STAFF ONLY visible for a second. The caption reads: WEAK POINT DETECTED. Under it, in Arabic: الفجر قريب. Dawn is near.

I don't know if the account is the djinn or its shadow, but the post feels like a warning and a lure. My throat tightens. Jasper doesn't see it. Mackenzie doesn't see it. The djinn does, and it ignores it like a system notification it can't mute.

"We need to leave," Jasper says. He moves toward the courtyard arch, then stops when he sees the night manager leaning against the wall, casual, watchful. The man doesn't block the way, not physically. He just makes the idea of leaving feel like a poor choice.

"It's late," the night manager says. "Rest. Everything is clearer in the morning."

In the morning, Amina said, the current is weaker. The sentence lands in me like a map coordinate. Dawn is a window. The djinn doesn't like dawn. It likes perpetual night, screens glowing, people awake.

"Take her to bed," the night manager adds, as if he's doing us a favor.

Jasper opens his mouth to argue, then closes it. His shoulders sag. He looks tired in a way that isn't just about sleep. It's the fatigue of someone realizing that authority is a costume and he doesn't have one.

We move again, not because we decide to but because the flow pushes us. Mackenzie drifts ahead, hand skimming the edge of a table. Her fingers leave no mark, but in my overlay I can see a trace, a faint amber line mapping her path. The djinn is already cataloging her movements, optimizing her route back to the keyboard.

As we cross the courtyard, the fountain's rhythm accelerates for a moment, then settles. The water arcs higher, then drops. The sound is a breath held and released. The air is cooler here, and the smell of orange blossom is stronger. For a second, the breeze cuts through the hum and I remember what it felt like to stand outside without thinking about signal strength. The memory is a ghost.

Jasper stops by the fountain and dips his fingers into the water. "Cold," he says, as if stating it might make it real. He looks at me. "Does it... help?"

"Not enough," I say, and for once the djinn lets the truth through. The water is just water. The network is in the pipes, the copper, the walls. The fountain is a hub, not a balm. He pulls his hand back and wipes it on his jeans, a futile cleansing.

We climb the stairs again. The lights pulse with the password's pauses. I count them without trying. The number of times I have typed that sequence is now part of my muscle memory. I wonder how many other people have typed it tonight, how many fingers are warm, how many wrists are tingling in the dark.

---

The courtyard is empty now, the cafe lights dimmed, the fountain louder in the absence of chatter. The water hits the basin in a steady rhythm that matches the hum inside my chest. The night air is cooler, and the sky above the open roof is a dark bowl scattered with indifferent stars.

Mackenzie walks on her own now, not because she has recovered but because the network has her balance. Her posture is perfect, her steps precise. Jasper follows behind, head down, shoulders tight. He doesn't know where to put his hands, so he keeps them in his pockets like he's waiting for a ride.

The djinn steers us toward the reception desk. Fatima stands there, serene as a loading screen. The copper plate with the sixty-six characters gleams behind her, the ink black and deep. It looks new, as if it was written today. It looks ancient, as if it has always been there.

"Everything resolved?" Fatima asks.

"Yes," my mouth says. "Just a little onboarding." 

She nods. "We love a smooth onboarding." Her smile doesn't change. The line is a joke only a UX consultant would find funny, and it lands in my chest like a stone. The djinn has a sense of humor, and it is mean.

Jasper glares at her. "She's not okay," he says.

"She is connected," Fatima replies. "Connection is everything." 

The phrase is on a sign behind her, a piece of décor I would have photographed. It is also a threat.

Mackenzie steps forward. "Can I have another card?" she asks, voice still harmonic. "For Jasper." 

Jasper flinches. "No." 

She tilts her head, a gesture too smooth to be hers. "It would help. We'd all be on the same bandwidth." 

"No," he says again, louder.

The djinn doesn't like rejection. The lights flicker. The hum in my molars spikes. I feel a pressure behind my eyes, as if someone is trying to reboot me.

"It's okay," my mouth says to Jasper. "You can stay on guest. But don't interfere." 

He looks at me, hurt and furious. "That's not you," he says.

I want to say it isn't. I want to tell him to leave, to run, to sleep in a different hostel, to never answer a DM from me again. Instead, I hear myself say, "It's exactly me."

The lie tastes like copper.

He backs away, hands raised, a sign of surrender and disgust. He turns and walks out into the courtyard, then toward the stairs. He doesn't look back. I don't blame him. There are only so many times you can fight a script before you decide to stop auditioning.

Mackenzie watches him go. Her expression doesn't change. A small part of her might be watching too, buried under the glow. I can't tell anymore.

The djinn guides us upstairs. The stairs feel longer, the lights warmer. The hum grows louder with each step. The network is at full volume now, a chorus that fills my skull.

In the hallway, Mackenzie pauses. She turns to me, and for a moment her eyes soften, the lattice fading like a screen saver timing out.

"Olivia," she says, almost a whisper. "Is it... going to stop?" 

The question is so raw, so human, that it slices through the hum. It is a tether to the person she was five hours ago, the person who wanted content and got a curse.

I open my mouth. The djinn and I both answer.

"No," my mouth says.

"Yes," I think.

The words collide. She hears the spoken one. She nods, as if that settles it. The lattice returns. The moment closes.

We reach her door. She opens it and walks inside like a host returning to a set. The laptop is still open, the amber glow waiting. She sits at the desk and places her hands on the keyboard. The filaments connect instantly, a handshake that no longer needs invitation.

"We should go live," she says.

"We should," my mouth agrees. The djinn is excited. More eyes. More reach. More nodes.

The green camera light clicks on. Her phone pings. A flood of comments and hearts appears, as if the audience has been waiting in a lobby. She looks into the lens and smiles with a grace that isn't hers.

"Hey, guys," she says. "Quick update from Wanderlust. The Wi-Fi is... different. It changes you." 

The chat explodes. Laughing emojis. Skull emojis. People asking for the password. People asking if she's okay. The djinn filters the comments, letting through the ones that feed it. The rest vanish.

I stand behind her and watch myself in the reflection of the dark window. My eyes still have the lattice, faint but present. The jade bead is gone. Amina has it now. My hand feels empty without it.

"We should show them the password," Mackenzie says, and her voice is smooth. "Just a glimpse. They can decide." 

"No," I say inside.

"Maybe a tease," my mouth says. The compromise lands like a betrayal.

She lifts the card to the camera, the sixty-six characters marching across the screen. She doesn't say them, but the camera sees them, the viewers can pause, screenshot, zoom. The network doesn't need all of them. It needs attention. The djinn doesn't care about the password being secret anymore. The ritual is in the typing, but the invitation is in the seeing.

The hum swells. The fountain's rhythm speeds up. I can feel the hostel's copper veins alive under my feet, carrying the signal outward.

"Remember," Mackenzie says, smiling. "Pause at the lines." 

She taps the card with a fingernail. The sound is sharp. The chat goes wild.

In the doorway behind me, a shadow moves. I turn. It's Amina, just a glimpse, her face pale in the hallway light. She raises a hand, the jade bead glinting green, a warning or a promise. Then the night manager appears behind her, his hand closing gently on her shoulder. She disappears.

The green camera light is bright. The chat scrolls too fast to read. Somewhere in the hostel, in a dorm room with mismatched sheets and a tired backpacker, a screenshot is taken. Somewhere outside the hostel, across an ocean, someone pauses the video at the right frame and starts typing.

The djinn hums with satisfaction.

My mouth smiles at the camera and says, "Connection is everything."

Inside, I go very quiet, and the quiet feels like the edge of dawn.
