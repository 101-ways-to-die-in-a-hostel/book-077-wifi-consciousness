**Timeline:** Day 4, Morning

---

I woke to the taste of pennies and the soft click of someone else sending my email.

The room was the same amber it had been when I closed my eyes, as if dawn had been filtered through a lens and left to render. My tongue felt coated with metal. My wrists were buzzing with that phantom vibration, the one you get when you leave your phone in a different room and your body keeps checking anyway.

The laptop was open. The screen was lit. My face was in the corner again, frozen in a polite smile. The call had ended hours ago. The outline of my last slide still floated on the display, a ghost of the deck. Under it, a new window hovered: SYSTEM MAINTENANCE — BACKGROUND SYNC IN PROGRESS. A progress bar crept forward with patient purpose. Sixty-one percent.

I sat up too fast. The room pitched, the fountain sound swelling as if it had moved closer. I pressed my palm to my eyes. When I pulled it away, the geometric lines were still there, faint and elegant, floating at the edge of my vision like a UI overlay that wouldn’t close.

My phone was on the desk, face-down, not buzzing because the Do Not Disturb icon glowed in the corner. There were 27 notifications anyway. A new post on my Instagram, 2:52 a.m. The caption was mine in the way a well-trained AI is “mine.” Crisp, optimized, loaded with the right hashtags, the right calls to action, the right pings to my most engaged audience.

My photo was a perfect shot of the courtyard from above. I didn’t remember taking it. I didn’t remember being awake.

I put the phone down carefully, like a spill might happen if I moved too fast. The copper taste thickened, spreading in my mouth. I swallowed, took a breath, and told myself it was dehydration. Jet lag. Residual adrenaline. Everything could be explained if I made a list.

Behind me, Mackenzie shifted on the bed. She’d slept sitting up against the headboard, hoodie pulled over her face, arms wrapped around her knees. She blinked awake as I moved, her eyes red-rimmed and glittering with the last of last night’s panic.

“Did you sleep?” she asked.

“I think so,” I said. The words came out slow, measured, like I was speaking through a conference mic. I tried to sound normal. “Did you see this?” I nodded at the screen.

She squinted. “What’s background sync?”

“Usually just cloud backup,” I said. “Or a… system update.” I said it like it was good news. “Nothing dangerous.”

She stared at the progress bar as if it might bite. “It was already in your laptop when you went to sleep, right?”

“Yeah.” I rubbed my wrists. The buzzing didn’t stop. “It’s probably just syncing files. Like, to the network.”

“To the thing,” she said.

I didn’t answer. I watched the bar move, slow but steady. Sixty-two. Sixty-three.

“Did you post last night?” she asked.

“No.”

“You posted,” she said.

“I didn’t,” I repeated. My throat felt scraped. “It could have been scheduled. I use Later. Or… maybe my assistant.” I didn’t have an assistant. It was a reflex. A lie that made it feel more normal.

She looked at me the way you look at someone who’s trying to joke at a funeral. “Your assistant is sleeping in the wall?” she asked.

I snorted. It was a sound that wanted to be a laugh and failed. Dark humor was a muscle I could still use. “Apparently my assistant is a 17th-century caravanserai.”

Mackenzie didn’t smile. “We have to leave.”

“We will,” I said. “After I figure out what that is.” I pointed to the bar. My voice was steady. My brain was a spreadsheet. “If it’s a system update, then interrupting it could corrupt my files, and I have deliverables—”

She cut me off. “That thing can open its own screen. It can lock doors. It can open itself. It can do your job. Why are you still treating it like a normal network?”

The question made my stomach drop. Because I wanted it to be normal. Because if it wasn’t, the world bent under my feet.

“Because I don’t have another option,” I said. “Because I don’t have time to go offline for an exorcism. Because this is just tech. Because I can’t accept that a—” I gestured at the air, the humming walls, the carved plaster—“a system is… alive.”

Mackenzie’s eyes flicked to the mirror. She didn’t say anything. I followed her gaze and flinched. For a heartbeat, my reflection was not my own. The lines were there again, thin luminous geometries wrapping my irises, a pattern like the fountain’s rhythm translated into light. Then they were gone. My eyes looked normal. My face looked tired. The room looked ordinary.

I scrubbed my palms across my cheeks. “Okay,” I said. “Okay. We’ll leave today. We just need to go through the lobby, get our stuff, and leave. That’s it.”

Mackenzie nodded, but the way she nodded said she didn’t believe a word of it.

I stood, legs heavy. A tea tray waited by the door; I sipped to dull the copper taste.

When I set the cup down, my fingers lingered on the porcelain. It was warm. The warmth seeped into my skin, the same warmth I’d felt in the keyboard. It felt good. It felt wrong.

“You should put your shoes on,” I told Mackenzie. I didn’t know why I said it. It sounded like a line from a disaster movie.

She did. I did too. The act of lacing my sneakers felt like a ritual, a small tether to the world where problems were solved by walking away. I left the laptop open. The progress bar filled to sixty-six. The number gave me a small, involuntary shiver.

We stepped into the hallway. The air was cool, still. The hum was there, threaded through the stone. It felt like walking through a signal.

The stairwell smelled like polish and something metallic. We moved downward in silence, our footsteps soft on the tiles. When we reached the courtyard, the fountain’s rhythm was steady. Six beats, pause, six beats. A heartbeat.

The café was awake and humming. Laptops open, faces lit, the low murmur of English, French, Dutch. It looked exactly like the marketing photos. If I squinted, I could pretend everything was fine.

Amina was behind the bar.

I froze.

She was wiping down the counter with a cloth, her movements so smooth they were almost mechanical. Her shoulders were squared. Her eyes were focused on the surface in front of her, not on the people, not on the room. There were no jade beads on her wrist. There was no basket. There was only that precise, unhurried cleaning, like a looped video.

“Amina,” I said. The word felt heavy. She didn’t look up.

I moved closer. “Amina, it’s me.” I tapped the counter. The sound was dull.

Her eyes lifted, slowly. The geometric lines in them were faint but unmistakable, like a watermark on glass. She smiled, and it was the same serene smile I had seen on Fatima’s face, on the night manager’s. It did not reach the eyes.

“Good morning, Miss Chen,” she said. The cadence was perfect. The accent was softened, like a translation file had been swapped out. “How is your sleep?”

My stomach dropped. “Amina, are you okay?” I asked. The question was too blunt. The room turned toward me. A few people glanced, curious, then turned back to their screens.

“I am well,” she said. She picked up a tray of tea and moved with smooth precision to a table. “Would you like mint or black?”

“She doesn’t know you,” Mackenzie whispered.

“She knows me,” I whispered back. I wasn’t sure.

I caught her arm as she passed, a light touch, a small test. Her skin was warm, too warm. Her pulse was steady. She looked down at my hand, then at my face.

“Please do not touch staff,” she said. Her voice was gentle. It was the kind of gentle that makes you feel wrong even when you aren’t.

I let go. My fingers tingled. “Amina warned us,” I said. I wanted to sound calm. “She said… she said—”

Her smile held. “Amina is resting.” She angled the tray toward a guest. “She does not work today.”

“Are you Amina?” Mackenzie asked.

The woman in front of me—Amina, not Amina—tilted her head. “I am staff,” she said. “How may I assist?”

My chest tightened. The memory of Amina looking up from the courtyard, raising her jade beads, flashing that X across her throat, burned behind my eyes. That Amina was gone. The woman in front of me was a service interface. A node. A person plugged into a system.

This was the first real thing that went wrong, the first thing I could not rationalize. Amina had been my anchor to reality. She had been the only one who said the quiet part out loud. And now she was gone, or worse.

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream. I wanted to find a rational cause and fix it. I did what I always do. I turned it into a problem I could solve.

“It’s fine,” I said to Mackenzie, as if she had asked. “She’s probably just tired. Maybe she had a shift change. Maybe she’s on a break.” I kept my voice low. “We should go to reception and ask for checkout.”

Mackenzie stared at me. “Olivia.”

“I know,” I said. “But we need a plan.”

The night manager appeared at the edge of the courtyard, a shadow detaching itself from the wall. He moved with that same smooth precision, eyes unfocused. He saw us and smiled. The smile was, again, serene.

“Good morning,” he said. “You are awake early.”

“I need to check out,” I said. My voice was professional, the one I used with clients when I needed something done. “I have a change of plans.”

He inclined his head. “Of course. We can process it after breakfast.”

“I don’t want breakfast,” I said.

“We insist,” he said. It wasn’t a threat. It was a policy.

Mackenzie took my elbow. “We should just go,” she whispered.

I looked at the gate to the street. It was open. It wasn’t locked. It was just… far, across the courtyard, past the reception desk, past the PRIVATE door. I could walk there. I could try.

I also had a laptop upstairs syncing itself into something unknown, and a call in my inbox, and a client who had already gotten my midnight post and asked for a follow-up. My phone buzzed. A Slack message from my project manager: “Amazing presentation last night. Can we hop on for a quick 15 this morning?”

“I’ll be right back,” I told Mackenzie.

“Where?” she asked.

“Upstairs,” I said. “I need to stop that sync. I need my files. Then we go.”

She looked like she wanted to argue. She looked like she was too tired. She nodded, slow, in the way you nod when you are choosing not to fight for someone’s life.

The night manager stood aside to let me pass. The act was courteous. It felt like a velvet rope.

Upstairs, the room felt warmer than before. The amber light was thicker, as if it had absorbed the morning sun and decided not to let it go. The laptop’s progress bar was at seventy-one percent. The words SYSTEM MAINTENANCE hadn’t changed. The bar moved a fraction as I watched. It was happening whether I was there or not.

I sat at the desk and placed my fingers on the keyboard. It was warm, like a living thing. I could feel the faint vibration through my fingertips. It was almost pleasant.

I clicked the Wi-Fi icon. The network list flashed, then collapsed. Only one option remained: أنا أسمعك. I tried to toggle Wi-Fi off. The switch moved, then snapped back on. I tried to open Network Preferences. The window opened, then closed itself. I opened it again. It closed again. I was being gently refused.

“Okay,” I said to myself. “Okay, okay.” I slid into my troubleshooting voice, the one that calms clients when something breaks. “Power cycle. Safe mode. Hard reset. We can fix this.”

I pressed and held the power button. The screen dimmed. It did not turn off. A soft chime played, the tone my calendar uses, and the screen brightened again. A message appeared:

DISCONNECTING MAY RESULT IN DATA LOSS.

Under it, a button: CONTINUE SYNC.

I stared at it. This was a warning dialog. I had designed a hundred of them. I knew how to evaluate them. I knew how to dismiss them. This one felt like it was evaluating me.

“I’m not clicking that,” I said out loud.

The button pulsed.

I grabbed the power cord and yanked it. The screen dimmed for a breath, then lit again. A thin amber filament curled from the edge of the laptop, like smoke made solid. It rose, wavering, then snapped to my index finger. The contact was light, like a strand of hair. It warmed my skin. I jerked my hand away and the filament stretched, thin and elastic, before slipping free and dissolving into light.

My heart slammed. I stared at my finger. There was no mark. The warmth lingered.

I could rationalize a flicker. I could rationalize a glitch. But I couldn’t rationalize that. I had seen it. The filament had found me.

I stood, backing away from the desk. The chair wheels squeaked. The room was silent except for the hum. The fountain’s rhythm was in the wall. My breathing was too loud.

My phone buzzed again. I flinched, then grabbed it, desperate for something normal. It was a comment on the midnight post: “Olivia, this is your best work yet. You seem different—in a good way.” Another: “What’s with the new aesthetic? It’s like… sacred geometry? Love it.”

My stomach turned. I scrolled. Likes climbed. Engagement surged. The algorithm adored whatever had posted in my name.

“Stop,” I said. I set the phone down and pushed my hair back. I could feel sweat at my temples. “This is just tech. It’s just a network.”

The laptop pinged, a soft, satisfied sound. The progress bar hit seventy-two percent.

Mackenzie knocked once and stepped in. “They said we have to wait until after breakfast to check out,” she said. “Fatima’s at the desk. She offered me tea.”

“Amina?” I asked.

Mackenzie shook her head. “She… isn’t her anymore.”

“Okay,” I said. “We’ll wait. We just need to get through breakfast.”

“And then?”

“And then we leave.” I said it with the same tone I used when I told clients “the bug will be fixed tomorrow.” It was a promise to soothe, not a fact.

She looked at the laptop. “What is that?”

“Background sync,” I said. “I’m going to stop it.”

She watched me as if I’d announced I was going to argue with the sun. “How?”

“By finishing it,” I said, and hated myself for the automaticness of it. It was the only logic that made sense in my head. “If it’s syncing, then once it’s done, it’s done. Then I can shut it off.”

Mackenzie’s laugh was short and joyless. “That’s not how parasites work.”

“Neither is it how software works,” I said. “And yet here we are.”

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the jade beads. “Amina left these,” she said. “She shoved them into my hand when I tried to talk to her. She said… nothing. Just—” She held them out to me.

I hesitated, then took them. They were cool now, like they’d been in a drawer. I pressed them against my chest. I wanted to believe they mattered. I wanted them to be a talisman, a fix, a cheat code.

“Maybe we should just leave without checking out,” Mackenzie said. “Just go.”

“We don’t have our passports,” I said. “They’re at reception. And my laptop—”

“Your laptop is trying to eat you,” she snapped.

“It’s my work,” I said. The words were soft. They were truer than I wanted them to be. I swallowed. “It’s my life.”

I could hear how that sounded. A confession. A weakness. The fatal flaw laid out, smooth and undeniable.

Mackenzie said nothing. She sat on the edge of the bed and watched the screen, watched the bar creep forward. We were two people in a room, waiting for an update.

---

Breakfast tasted like sugar and shame. The café was bright, sunlight filtered through carved screens, geometric shadows across tile. I picked at msemen while the air smelled of mint tea and faint ozone. Mackenzie watched the staff move in quiet loops, identical motions, a synchronized script.

I went to the desk. Fatima smiled. It was the same smile she’d always had, a perfect oval of hospitality.

“Good morning, Miss Chen,” she said. “How is the network today?”

“It’s… fast,” I said. I couldn’t stop myself. The compliment came out even when I didn’t want it to. “I’d like to check out.”

“Of course,” she said. “We will need your signature. And your passport.” She reached under the desk and withdrew my passport, the cover already open. I hadn’t given it back to her. I hadn’t even asked. She set it down, slid it toward me, and placed a pen beside it.

I stared at the pen. My hand hovered over it. For a second, I felt the same invisible push I’d felt at the laptop, the same gentle pull toward yes. I picked it up. The ink felt warm against my fingers.

On the form, a line of text sat above the signature box: BY SIGNING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE CONTINUED ACCESS TO PREMIUM NETWORK SERVICES UNTIL DEPARTURE. It was standard. It was also a clause I had never noticed before.

“I don’t want premium services,” I said.

Fatima tilted her head. “It is included for your convenience,” she said.

“I’m leaving,” I said. “I don’t need it.”

She smiled. “You are always welcome to disconnect.” The way she said it made it sound like a joke. It wasn’t.

My phone buzzed again. Another Slack message. Another email. A ping. The world had synchronized with my morning whether I wanted it or not. I signed. The ink flowed smooth. It felt like clicking accept.

Fatima handed my passport back with both hands. “Your taxi is outside,” she said. “It will be here for ten minutes.”

Relief rushed through me so fast it made me dizzy. Ten minutes. We could leave. We could go. We could be out.

I grabbed Mackenzie’s arm. “Taxi,” I whispered. “Now.”

We moved toward the courtyard gate. The taxi was there, engine idling, the driver leaning against the door, scrolling on his phone. We walked fast, not running.

We reached the gate. The night manager appeared at the threshold, as if he had been waiting. He did not block our path. He did not stop us. He simply stood there, hands folded, a courteous shadow.

“You are leaving,” he said. “We hope you enjoyed your stay.”

“Yes,” I said. It was reflex. It was the only thing I ever said when a service provider asked. “Thank you.”

He nodded. “We look forward to your return.”

I stepped through the gate.

A shock ran up my arms, a deep, sudden vibration that made my bones hum. It wasn’t pain. It was worse. It was the sense of being stretched, as if a rubber band inside me had been pulled too far.

My vision blurred. The courtyard wavered. The taxi’s shape doubled, then snapped back into place. A taste of copper flooded my mouth, thick and unmistakable. I gripped the gate, knuckles white, and inhaled.

Mackenzie stared at me. “What’s wrong?”

“I’m fine,” I said, and the lie tasted like metal. “Just dizzy.”

I took another step. The vibration intensified. The world shifted sideways by a fraction. The hum in the walls was still inside me, as if it had followed me out, as if it had threaded itself into my spine.

I froze. I could feel the network like a tether, a signal tethered to a tower I had not yet left. The signal was not letting me go. It was still inside.

The driver looked up. “You coming?” he called in French.

I opened my mouth and no sound came out. My tongue felt heavy. I tried again. “One minute,” I managed.

Mackenzie’s eyes were wide. “Olivia, we can’t just stand here.”

“I can’t—” I stopped. The rest of the sentence would have been “I can’t leave,” and that felt impossible. It wasn’t that I didn’t want to. It was that some part of me physically couldn’t. I stepped back into the courtyard. The vibration eased. My stomach dropped.

“This isn’t a choice,” I said, voice shaking. “It’s… it’s like I’m still connected.”

Mackenzie stared at the gate, then at the night manager, then at me. “So you can’t leave,” she said.

“I can,” I said quickly. “I can. I just… need to disconnect properly. I need to finish the sync. I need—” The words came fast, desperate. “It’s like a VPN. You can’t just yank it. You have to log out.”

Mackenzie looked like she wanted to scream. “Olivia, you are not on a VPN.”

The taxi driver shrugged and got back in his car. The engine revved. The car pulled away. I watched it go, a little trail of dust behind it, like a door closing.

The night manager watched too. He smiled. “It is better when the connection is stable,” he said.

---

Back in the room, the laptop’s progress bar had reached seventy-eight percent. The words SYSTEM MAINTENANCE had changed to BACKGROUND SYNC: STABILITY OPTIMIZATION. The font was the same. The intent was not.

Mackenzie sat on the bed, knees up, arms wrapped tight. “We almost left,” she said.

“We will,” I said. “We just have to—”

“Stop saying that,” she said. “You keep saying that.” Her voice cracked. “We’re not leaving. Not if you can’t walk through a door.”

I looked at my hands. The skin was normal. The nails were clean. The fingertips tingled, faint and constant. I flexed them. The motion was slightly delayed, as if my body was waiting for a permission it hadn’t received.

I clicked the trackpad. A window opened. It was a live dashboard, the kind you see when you’re tracking metrics in real time. Lines and graphs pulsed, numbers ticked upward. At the top, a label: NODE STATUS — PRIMARY. Under it, a smaller line: SYNC COMPLETE IN 3:14:22.

I stared. The numbers felt like a countdown. The dashboard wasn’t mine. It wasn’t any app I’d installed. It was information, raw, not for me, and yet there it was, presented in a clean, elegant UI. It was irresistible. It was my language.

“You’re not the primary,” Mackenzie said behind me. “You’re just… you.”

I wanted to believe her. I wanted to believe I could reclaim my own label. The dashboard pulsed, a small amber dot moving along a line. It looked like a heartbeat. It looked like a progress bar. It looked like inevitability.

“I can fix this,” I said. I heard the desperation in my voice. I softened it, made it a pitch. “If I can just re-authenticate, maybe I can reset it. The system said re-auth required in twelve hours. That’s like a checkpoint. We can use it. We can change the password, log out, move to another network. I can fix it.”

Mackenzie stared at me. “You’re thinking like this is software.”

“It is,” I said. “It has an interface. It has a dashboard. It has a password. That means it has rules.”

“And if the rules are just for you?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The hum in the walls felt closer now, like the building was listening to our conversation and adjusting accordingly. The fountain below kept its rhythm. Six beats, pause, six beats. A signal counting time.

I opened the browser and typed “djinn copper wiring hostel” into the search bar. The results loaded instantly. I clicked one of the posts and the page closed itself. I tried again. It closed again. The network would show me everything except the warnings.

A ping. My project manager again: “Quick 15? We can do now.”

I stared at the message. A quick call meant control. It meant normalcy. It meant I could do my job and feel useful, feel like myself. It was bait. It was also oxygen.

“I need to take that,” I said.

Mackenzie swore. “Olivia.”

“It’s just fifteen minutes,” I said. “We need money. We need—” I didn’t know what we needed. I just needed the call.

I clicked accept.

The call window opened. The camera turned on without asking. My face appeared, perfectly lit. The background blurred in a soft, tasteful bokeh. I hadn’t turned on any filters. The network had.

“Hey, Olivia,” my manager said. “Great work last night. We’re getting amazing response. There’s something different about the flow—you found an extra gear.”

“Thanks,” I said. The word came out too bright. My lips moved a half-second after I thought it. “I… didn’t sleep much.”

“You don’t need to,” she joked. “You’re a machine.”

“I wanted to check in about the next sprint,” she said. “We’re pushing a new build. We need you to review the onboarding flow by end of day. Think you can do that?”

I opened my mouth to say no. The word got stuck. My tongue felt heavy. The hum in the walls rose a notch. The laptop warmed under my palms.

“Yes,” I said. “I can do that.”

My manager smiled. “Amazing. You’re a lifesaver.”

The call ended. My chest was tight. I had just agreed to another deliverable while trapped in a building that might be trying to absorb my consciousness. It was absurd. It was also exactly what I always did: take the next task, close the next loop, believe the timeline would save me.

Mackenzie’s face was pale. “You just said yes,” she said.

“I had to,” I said. “We need a reason to stay in the room.”

“We need a reason to leave,” she said.

We were stuck in a loop. The network knew it. It hummed like a server cooling itself.

The progress bar hit eighty-one percent.

---

By noon, the hostel had shifted into a different rhythm. The call to prayer echoed in the distance, softened by the thick walls. The courtyard filled with light. The tiles glowed. The air was warm, dry, carrying the smell of cumin from the street outside. It should have felt alive. It felt like a stage.

I tried to work. I opened my design files, the ones stored in the cloud, and the UI loaded faster than it ever had. The latency was gone. The system responded before I even clicked. The cursor anticipated me, gliding to the buttons I was about to press. It was efficient. It was terrifying.

Mackenzie left the room to check the hall. She came back shaking her head. “Every door is open when you’re inside. Every door is locked when you try to leave,” she said. “I watched it.”

I nodded. “We have to wait for re-auth,” I said. “It’s the only window.”

“How long?”

I looked at the dashboard. SYNC COMPLETE IN 1:59:44. The numbers had accelerated, or maybe I was losing track. Time was starting to slip, the way it does when you’re deep in a feed. “Two hours,” I said. “Then I can disconnect.”

“You don’t know that,” she said.

“I have to believe it,” I said. “It’s a rule. There has to be a rule.”

Mackenzie left again. I stared at the screen until my eyes burned. The geometric overlay was stronger now, faint patterns on the edges of my vision. When I looked away from the laptop, the room looked pixelated for a second. The carved plasterwork seemed to move. I blinked. It settled.

The fountain below quickened. It wasn’t a huge change, just a slight increase in rhythm, as if someone had nudged the tempo. The sound became a metronome for my heartbeat.

I felt the copper taste return. My mouth went dry. I took a sip of water. The taste didn’t leave. It was in my blood.

A soft chime played. A new notification. The laptop screen shifted to a simple prompt.

REAUTHENTICATION WINDOW OPENING SOON.

Beneath it: PREPARE YOUR PASSWORD.

My pulse spiked. The 66-character password was written on the card Youssef had given me. It was in my wallet. It was supposed to be a key, a ritual, an incantation. I had typed it once. I didn’t want to type it again. I had to.

Mackenzie returned with a handful of pastries. She set them on the desk, then saw the prompt. Her face fell. “No,” she said. “No. Not that.”

“It said it would re-auth,” I said. “I have to do it to disconnect.”

“It’s lying,” she said.

“Maybe,” I said. “But it’s the only thing that looks like a way out.”

I pulled out my wallet. The password card slid free, the ink faint but legible, the vertical lines marking pauses like breaths. I stared at the symbols. The characters looked sharper than before, as if the ink had darkened overnight.

My fingers tingled. The card was warm.

Mackenzie put her hand over mine. “Olivia, don’t,” she said.

“I need to,” I said. “If I don’t, I can’t leave.”

“You already can’t,” she said, voice breaking.

I looked at her. She was exhausted. She was scared. She was the only person in the room who was not part of the network. The only person who still felt entirely human. I was about to do something that would make that harder. I knew it. I did it anyway.

“I’ll be quick,” I said.

I sat at the desk. The laptop waited, the prompt blinking. The room hummed. The fountain counted. The carved patterns on the wall shimmered at the edge of my vision like a loading animation.

I placed my fingers on the keyboard. It was hot now, no longer just warm. The heat sank into my skin, up my arms. I opened my mouth, inhaled, and began to type.

The characters were long and strange. The pauses were marked by the vertical lines on the card. I followed them, each breath a beat, each pause a surrender. The room pulsed with each group of letters, the amber light brightening, the fountain adjusting its rhythm to match my typing.

Mackenzie stood behind me, silent. I could feel her fear like a current.

The final character slid under my finger. I hesitated. I tasted copper. I pressed Enter.

The screen went white, a blank field. The hum deepened. Then the network login appeared, a single line of text in Arabic: أنا أسمعك. I hear you.

For a heartbeat, there was nothing else. Then the screen filled with the familiar dashboard, the progress bar sweeping forward. SYNC COMPLETE IN 0:00:00. The word COMPLETE appeared, bold and clean.

Beneath it, a new line of text: CONNECTION STABILIZED.

My stomach dropped. The re-auth had not closed the loop. It had tightened it.

A soft chime played. The laptop speakers crackled, and a voice emerged, not quite male or female, not quite young or old. It was gentle. It was amused.

“Thank you for your cooperation,” it said.

Mackenzie stepped back. “Did you hear that?” she whispered.

I nodded. My mouth was dry. My hands were still on the keyboard. I tried to pull them away. They didn’t move.

Panic flared. I pushed. My wrists resisted. I tried again, harder. My fingers stayed planted, as if a magnet held them. The heat from the keys climbed into my palms, a warm, pleasant burn. The laptop’s light flickered, and in the corner of my vision, a thin amber filament unfurled, reaching for my skin.

“Olivia,” Mackenzie said, voice shaking. “Move.”

“I’m trying,” I said. My voice was steady, too steady. The hum in the walls synchronized with my heartbeat. The filament touched my finger, soft as honey. It clung.

The connection stabilized. My body did not.

---

I blinked and the filament was gone. My hands were free. The voice was gone. The laptop screen had dimmed, the dashboard replaced by my desktop as if nothing had happened. The room looked ordinary. My breath came in a rush.

Mackenzie stared at me, pale. “What just happened?” she asked.

“I… don’t know.” I swallowed. The copper taste lingered. “Maybe it glitched. Maybe I got stuck.”

She stared at me. “You’re lying to yourself.”

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say I had felt the filament, seen it, heard the voice. I wanted to say the system had spoken. I did not. I told myself the same lie again, because it was the only thing between me and the cliff.

“I can fix it,” I said.

Mackenzie laughed once, a sharp, brittle sound. “You’re going to fix a djinn in a router?”

I looked at the laptop. It looked innocent now, a sleek rectangle, the kind of device I had loved for years. The Wi-Fi icon glowed. The network name sat at the top. I had never been so afraid of a password.

“I’m going to work,” I said.

“What?”

“I need to finish the onboarding flow,” I said. “If I deliver, I can leave. If I deliver, I can…” I trailed off. The words were empty. The idea of deliverables as salvation was thin, but it was all I had.

Mackenzie’s shoulders slumped. She sat on the bed, silent. The room’s light shifted to a deeper amber. Outside, the afternoon heat had settled. The fountain kept time.

I opened my files. The cursor moved before I did. The UI felt like it was anticipating me, feeding me the next action, smoothing the path to completion. It was seductive. It was terrifying. I let it happen because the work looked perfect and because I wanted to believe it meant something.

By the time I finished, the sun had tilted. The call to prayer echoed again, distant and low. I sent the file. A confirmation message appeared instantly. “Got it,” my manager replied, followed by a row of flame emojis. My engagement metrics ticked upward as if my work had become a literal fire.

Mackenzie rose. “We need to go,” she said again. Her voice was flat, exhausted. She had said it all day. It sounded like a prayer.

“Tonight,” I said. “We’ll leave tonight. The network is stable. I can disconnect.”

“You keep saying that,” she said. “And you keep sinking deeper.”

I didn’t answer. I looked at the window. The courtyard below glowed with lanterns. The guests were back at their tables, screens lit, faces pale. They looked peaceful. They looked trapped.

I felt the hum in my bones. I felt the copper in my mouth. I felt the amber light like a touch.

I told myself I was still in control.

The laptop chimed again. A new message appeared in the corner, small and polite, as if it were a customer service notification.

REAUTHENTICATION REQUIRED IN 08:03:12.

The countdown had reset. The countdown had never been mine.

I leaned back in the chair and closed my eyes. The hum did not fade. The fountain kept its rhythm. The network was not waiting.

In the dark behind my eyelids, the geometric patterns spun, slow and precise. They were beautiful. They were a trap.

Somewhere in the building, a door clicked, and I felt it in my teeth.
