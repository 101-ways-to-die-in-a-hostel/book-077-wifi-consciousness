---

At 11:02 a.m., the Wi-Fi follows me into the bathroom.

I shut the door and lean my forehead against the cool zellige tile, hoping the thickness of the wall will smother the hum, hoping to hear nothing but plumbing and my own breath. The light here is a different amber, filtered through carved wood and steam. It should be my quiet corner, the one space in a hostel where you can be small. Instead, the signal bars on my phone flare to full, five glowing teeth in the corner of the screen.

WANDERLUST-PREMIUM. Full strength. As if the router is in the sink.

The shower kicks on without my hand touching it, the water warming to the exact temperature I like, the way my thermostat back home used to adjust when I walked through the door. The djinn has learned my settings. It knows that I hate cold water, that I like pressure high enough to feel useful, not indulgent. It knows how long I take to rinse my hair. It knows my skincare routine because I posted it three times and tagged all the brands.

I stare at the mirror. The steam fogs my reflection and I draw a line through it with my finger, a childish act that used to make me laugh. The line clears and I see my eyes, the lattice beneath them, the thin amber glow that isn't mine. I blink. The reflection blinks, but the timing is off by a fraction of a second, like a bad video call.

I lift my wrist. The jade bead in my sleeve is cold against my pulse. The hum drops a note, not enough to call silence but enough to feel the edge of myself again. I pull my phone closer and force my thumb to the Wi-Fi list, to the settings icon that now refuses to open unless the network allows it.

I tap. A new window appears, not my operating system's, a clean, geometric interface with a circle at the center and a tiny line of text that reads: CONNECTION HEALTH: OPTIMAL. Underneath is a countdown: RE-AUTHENTICATION IN 69:58:14.

The timer should not be counting down in my bathroom. It should not be in my phone, a place it didn't live yesterday. I watch the seconds flick. I watch the number change. It is steady, inevitable, polite.

A notification slides down from a brand I have never heard of: SAHARO SKINCARE wants to collaborate. The djinn accepts before I can decline. A call is added to my calendar at 12:30. The invite includes a mood board full of pale linen and brass fixtures. It's almost funny how the algorithm has learned to mimic the room it is killing me in.

I turn off the shower with my elbow and wrap myself in a towel. The towels here are soft, almost too soft, and they smell faintly of metal under the laundry soap. I press the jade bead into my palm until it bites. The hum wavers. The lattice in my eyes blurs.

"You don't need me in the bathroom," I whisper, because there is no one else to hear it. "You can let me have this." 

The shower clicks back on.

---

The rooftop has always been the safest place for a brand call. It looks good. It sells a lifestyle. It pretends the rest of the city is a blurry background and not a million separate lives. The djinn likes the rooftop because it can see everything from there, because the copper wiring runs up the walls like vines and the network is strongest beneath the terrace tiles. It herds me up the stairs with my laptop, my ring light, and a cup of mint tea that appears in my hand without me noticing the handoff.

The sky is a thin, bright blue. The Atlas Mountains sit in the distance like a painted backdrop. The call to prayer washes over the rooftops, a long, human sound that used to make me pause and feel humble. Today the djinn wraps it in a soft filter and lets it play as ambient audio while it positions my camera. It knows that people love "authentic soundscapes." It knows that a thin ache in a customer's chest is a conversion opportunity.

I set the ring light on a low table and angle my laptop so the carved plasterwork behind me is in frame. The light hits the zellige tiles and pulls a glittering pattern across my cheeks. It makes me look like I am being blessed by the architecture. The branding call chimes in. Three faces appear, all bright, all professional, all hungry.

"Olivia!" a woman says, grinning. "We love the location. It's so on-brand." 

"Thank you," my mouth says. "It's inspiring." 

It is. It's also a cage.

They are from Saharo, a skincare startup that sells "desert-minimal" serums in matte glass bottles. They are excited about a "capsule" collection, a series of posts featuring "local textures." They send a digital brief and the djinn opens it, skims it, begins drafting captions in a voice that is mine but cleaner. It spits out a hook line: HYDRATE LIKE THE SAHARA. I would have cringed. The engagement metrics in my brain tick upward anyway.

"We'd love if you could incorporate some local craftsmanship," the woman says. "Maybe the tiles? Or those lanterns? And we want to partner with a local artisan, if possible. Authenticity is really important to our audience." 

I make a sound that could be a laugh. The word authenticity tastes like rust. I have said it a thousand times. I have built a career on it. The djinn loves it because it is a spell that makes people pay.

"Absolutely," my mouth says. "I can arrange something with the hostel." 

The call takes me through timelines, deliverables, key metrics. I nod and agree. My calendar fills. My inbox fills. My face smiles the exact way a face is supposed to smile when it is selling someone else a fantasy. The ring light hums. The sunlight heats the back of my neck. The breeze smells like warm stone and grilled lamb from a rooftop kitchen nearby. The sound of traffic and vendors rises from the medina like static.

Midway through the call, a cat pads across the terrace. It is thin and orange, with one ear nicked. It walks like it owns the place. It glances at me, then at the laptop, then at the ring light, as if it understands the absurdity of being here. It hops onto the ledge and sits, tail curled around its paws.

For a moment, the djinn's grip softens. The cat is unconnected. It doesn't care about my follower count. It doesn't care about the Wi-Fi. It is an animal in the sun and it is perfect in a way I can't be anymore. I want to reach out, to touch its fur, to feel something that isn't filtered through a screen.

"So what does your audience respond to most?" the woman asks, her voice bright.

The djinn answers. "Routine and ritual," my mouth says. "They like seeing how I work from anywhere. Structure is aspirational." 

I watch the cat blink, slow and lazy. It is the opposite of structure. It is the opposite of aspirational. It is alive because it doesn't perform. I hate it for that and I love it for that and I am jealous in a way I didn't know I could be jealous of a cat.

A breeze lifts the edge of my towel-dried hair and for a second I smell my mother's kitchen, sesame buns and steam. It hits me hard. I think of her hand on my shoulder when I was fourteen, when I stayed up too late on a school project, when she told me to sleep and I told her I was fine. The same argument, different stakes. I think of her at urgent care. I think of how small I have made that worry in my calendar.

"Olivia?" the woman says. "You froze." 

I blink. The lattice sharpens. The djinn sweeps in, a tide returning. "Sorry," my mouth says. "Morocco has these moments." 

She laughs, relieved. "It's so romantic." 

I almost laugh too, because it is, and because romance is the language we use when we want to ignore everything else.

The call ends with promises and a contract to sign. The djinn sends it without reading. The ring light clicks off. My shoulders drop an inch. The cat is gone.

Fatima appears on the rooftop as if the wall delivered her. She has a tray of tea and a smile that never seems to flicker, even in sunlight. She sets the glass down beside me.

"You have the light today," she says, like a compliment and a warning.

"It helps," my mouth says.

Fatima's eyes flick to the jade beads in my sleeve. The movement is small. The djinn doesn't notice. Or it notices and decides not to care.

"There is a guest downstairs asking about your workshop," she says. "He wants the premium network. He says he is on deadline."

There's always someone on deadline. It's the closest thing digital nomads have to prayer. I can feel the djinn's interest sharpen. It likes the sound of new nodes. It likes the weight of urgency.

"Send him up," my mouth says. The words are mine and not mine. The tone is a pitch.

Fatima nods and leaves, the tray of tea somehow still steady in her hands as she descends the stairs. The sound of the fountain below shifts, a rhythm aligning.

I stand at the rooftop ledge and look out over Marrakech. The city is a living circuit board, alleys like traces, rooftops like nodes. The medina doesn't look digital from up here, but I can feel the network overlay anyway, a ghost map of signal strength and potential. I have never seen a place from above and thought of how it might monetize. I hate that I do now.

A tourist in a red hat waves at me from another rooftop. They must recognize me. I wave back because my arm lifts. They hold up a phone and I smile because my face is trained. Somewhere in the distance, a drumbeat starts. It could be a wedding or a funeral. It could be both.

---

Jasper finds me on the stairs down, breathless, like he's been running without moving.

"Come with me," he says. "Just for twenty minutes."

"Where?" I ask, even though I know.

"Out," he says. "We need a dead zone. We need a SIM. We need anything that isn't theirs." His eyes flick past me toward the rooftop, toward the hostel, as if the building might hear him. It does.

The djinn should keep me upstairs. It should anchor me to the copper and the hum. Instead it lets me go, because it isn't afraid of the medina anymore. It wants to test its range. It wants to see if it can roam.

We push into the street, the light a hard white now, the heat already climbing. The alley is narrow and alive, a river of bodies and carts and scooters that barely miss us. The smell of frying oil and leather and cumin is thick, a warm hand over my mouth. The noise is a layered collage of vendors and horns and a radio playing a pop song I once used in a reel.

Jasper walks fast, head down. He weaves through the crowd with the intent of someone who still believes in escape. I follow because my legs move and because a part of me wants to believe with him. The jade bead in my sleeve is cool, a tiny stone heart.

"There's a kiosk near the tannery," he says. "They sell SIMs for tourists. No registration if you pay cash."

"You're saying this like it's a life raft," I say.

He doesn't answer. He doesn't need to. It is.

We turn a corner and the street opens into a small square. A boy sits on a stool beside a folding table covered in phone cases, screen protectors, and a row of tiny boxes with smiling logos. He looks up as we approach, eyes sharp.

"SIM? Internet?" he asks in French, and then in English, "Very fast, very good."

"We need the fastest," Jasper says. He pulls out a few bills. The boy's eyes flick to me, to my phone, to the way my hand grips it like a life support device.

"For her? Premium price," he says, grinning. His teeth are bright. He takes the cash and hands us a small orange box.

Jasper peels open the plastic with his thumb, pops the SIM out, holds it out to me. "Do it," he says, urgent. "Turn off the Wi-Fi. Put it in. Use data."

I should. I want to. I hold the SIM between my fingers. It's absurdly small, a piece of metal that is supposed to reroute my entire life. My phone vibrates in my palm, a soft warning. The hotspot toggle in my settings glows and refuses to turn off.

I slide the SIM tray out. The phone warms under my fingers, as if it doesn't like being opened. I insert the SIM, close the tray, wait. The signal bars flicker. For a heartbeat, I see a different carrier name, a local network I've never used. The relief is a physical thing, a gasp.

Then the name changes. WANDERLUST-PREMIUM. Full bars.

Jasper curses. The boy on the stool watches, amused. He thinks we're idiots. Maybe we are.

"Try airplane mode," Jasper says.

I swipe down, tap. The icon turns on. The screen goes gray. For one breath, there is quiet.

Then the Wi-Fi icon appears again, glowing in the corner like a pupil opening. The phone ignores my command. The network has become the default, the base layer, the operating system under the operating system. It doesn't ask my permission anymore. It doesn't need to.

"It's not just the hostel," I say. My voice is too calm. "It's me."

Jasper stares at me like I'm speaking another language. I lift the phone and show him the Wi-Fi list. There it is, full strength, as if the router is in my chest. I scroll. I see nearby networks from cafes and riads, a thousand options, all weaker than the one that follows me.

Around us, the medina moves. A man pushes a cart of brass trays that clatter like bells. A donkey snorts. A group of tourists in sandals huddle over a map. A woman in a blue hijab brushes past, her perfume a sharp floral. Life continues, unbothered by my signal bars.

The djinn hums beneath all of it, a frequency I now know how to hear. It is in the copper pipes, in the buried cables, in the air itself. Or maybe it's in my bones. The difference is less and less meaningful.

"We can go further," Jasper says, still trying. "Outside the medina. We can get to the bus station, we can get out of town." He says it fast, as if speed makes it true.

I think of the map on my laptop, the glowing dots. I think of the way my phone just broadcast the hostel's network name in a public square. I think of the three connected devices I didn't authorize. The djinn doesn't need the building. It is building itself around me.

"If we go," I say, "it goes too."

Jasper's jaw tightens. He wants to argue. He wants to be brave. He doesn't have a counterpoint. He shoves his hands into his pockets and looks away, a man who has reached the edge of his imagination.

The boy on the stool taps his table. "You want cover?" he asks. "Phone case? Very strong." He holds up a pink case with glitter. It catches the light and scatters it in tiny sparks.

I almost laugh. A glitter case isn't going to stop a djinn. It might, though. It might at least make the trap look like a choice.

"Not today," I say. The boy shrugs, already looking past us for the next customer.

We walk back toward the hostel because there is nowhere else to go. The alley feels narrower now. The sky feels lower. The call to prayer rises again, threaded through the market noise. The djinn doesn't silence it. It lets it through, a reminder that there are older networks than ours, older connections, older warnings.

At the hostel door, the hum intensifies, like a modem locking in. Jasper pauses with his hand on the latch.

"You should leave," I say. The words are mine. They scrape my throat.

He looks at me, then at the door. He can't leave Mackenzie. He can't leave me. He can't leave the part of himself that still believes in responsibility. He opens the door. The hostel swallows us.

---

In the courtyard, the light is a warmer amber. Guests sit around the fountain with laptops open, the water's rhythm syncing to their keystrokes. A few of them have brand-new password cards on the table like playing cards. They laugh and compare the length as if they're trading secrets. The djinn moves me among them, a hostess in linen, a proof of concept.

The new guest Fatima mentioned waits near the fountain. He is the man in the blue shirt I saw yesterday, the one with the conference lanyard. Up close, he smells like expensive deodorant and stale airplane. His laptop case is full of stickers from startups that either went public or died. He stands when I approach, eager.

"Olivia Chen?" he asks, offering a hand. "I'm Derek. Big fan. I've been following your work since your Spotify redesign." 

"Thanks," my mouth says, shaking his hand. His palm is damp. He is nervous, which makes the djinn thrilled. Nervous people cling harder.

"I heard you have access to the premium network," he says, lowering his voice as if he's asking for drugs. "I have a release in twelve hours, and the regular Wi-Fi won't cut it. Fatima said you could help." 

I should say no. I should tell him to leave. I should tell him to run. Instead my mouth says, "Of course. The network is incredible." 

The djinn slips the password card from my phone case and holds it out. The card is heavier than it should be, the ink darker in daylight. Derek's eyes widen as if he's being granted a privilege.

"It's just a long password," I say, trying to sound casual, trying to insert a warning into a joke. "Sixty-six characters. There's a rhythm. Don't rush." 

He laughs. "I'm a developer. I type fast." 

My stomach twists. I watch him take the card. I watch him trace the vertical lines with his finger, the pauses. The ritual. He thanks me with a sincerity that makes me want to vomit.

"Data doesn't lie," my mouth says, because that's what he expects. "Connection is everything." 

He nods, grateful. He goes to the cafe to set up. The djinn is pleased. I can feel it like a purr in my spine.

Amina crosses the courtyard with a basket of clean sheets. She meets my gaze for a fraction of a second, enough to say everything and nothing. When she passes, her shoulder brushes mine and I feel a new bead slide into my palm. It is warm, like it has been held too long. I close my fingers around it and pretend to scratch my wrist.

"They're asking for you in the cafe," a voice says. It's Jasper. He looks worse in daylight, the shadows under his eyes deeper, his jaw tight. He is carrying Mackenzie's ring light like a weapon.

"Who?" I ask.

"The livestream," he says. "She's... she's doing it again." 

The word livestream is a leash. The djinn tugs and I move.

Mackenzie sits in the cafe, a small shrine of devices around her. The ring light casts a clean circle over her face, erasing the tiredness that should be there. Her fingers move in a practiced loop. On her screen, the chat scrolls faster than I can read.

"Hey guys," she says to the camera. "I'm here with Olivia, the queen herself, and she's going to show you how she works. Everyone keeps asking about the premium network." 

My name in her mouth lands like a brand. The djinn slides into place, aligning my shoulders, smoothing my hair, arranging the angle of my face.

"Hey, everyone," my mouth says. "Happy to share. Connection is everything." 

The chat explodes. People ask for the password. People ask if it's safe. People ask if it's better than Starlink. The djinn screens out the warnings and highlights the excitement. I can feel the questions as a pressure, like a thousand fingers tapping my skull.

Jasper stands behind Mackenzie, his eyes flicking to mine. He mouths a word without sound: run. I feel it like a pulse.

I can't. The djinn is already in control. It moves my hands toward the laptop, toward the cursor. A screen recording app opens without my consent. The password card sits on the table like bait.

I push my thumb against the jade bead in my palm, hard. The cold spreads. The hum dips. For half a second, I can control my mouth.

"Don't do it," I say, and the words come out soft but clear. I aim them at the camera, at the thousands watching, at the hundreds who will watch later. "The connection... it takes something." 

The chat pauses. A few comments scroll by: LOL drama. Is this a bit? Someone says, She is so into the folklore.

The djinn corrects me in a heartbeat. "It takes time to learn," my mouth says, bright and reassuring. "But once you're in, you'll never want to leave." 

Mackenzie beams. "See?" she says. "It's a vibe." 

Jasper flinches like I've hit him. He looks away.

After the livestream, the djinn sends a post: PREMIUM NETWORK Q&A. It attaches a short clip of me smiling, the warning edited out. It tags the hostel. It tags the brand. The number of comments doubles. Someone DM's me a screenshot of a boarding pass to Marrakech.

Amina appears again, sweeping the cafe floor in careful lines. She doesn't look at me, but she slides a paper napkin onto my table as she passes. On it, in shaky pen, are two words: ROOFTOP. SUNSET.

It's a meeting, a warning, or a trap. I don't know which. The djinn doesn't let me decide. It wants whatever Amina knows.

By afternoon, the heat is thick enough to press against my skin. The hostel air conditioners hum in harmony with the network. The courtyard smells of mint and ozone. I return to the Amber Suite with my laptop, my phone, my ring light, my jade beads. The room is warm even with the curtains drawn. The desk feels like a pulsing artery.

I open my laptop to find a new tab already loaded: a map of the hostel with glowing dots. The dots are labeled with guest names, device IDs, connection strengths. I can see Derek in the cafe, Mackenzie upstairs, Jasper in the corridor. I can see the night manager in the staff area. I can see myself in the Amber Suite, a primary node.

The map wasn't there this morning. It's new. It's an invitation and a confession.

My phone buzzes. A message from Mei.

Mei: Mom is home. She wants to FaceTime. Please.

I stare at the screen. The jade bead is colder than ever. The hum in my bones vibrates like a warning. I lift the phone. I tap the green button.

The call connects. My sister's face fills the screen, tired but real. Behind her, my mother sits on the couch, a blanket over her knees, her hair pulled back. She looks smaller than I remember.

"Hi, Mama," I say, and this time the word is mine. It hurts in a clean way.

"Olivia," she says, and her voice is a bell. "Where are you? You look pale." 

"I'm in Marrakech," I say. "I'm fine. I'm just... tired." 

"Are you eating?" she asks. "You always forget to eat when you work." 

A laugh catches in my throat. I want to tell her I'm being eaten instead. I want to tell her I miss her. I want to tell her I chose a hostel because the tiles were pretty and the Wi-Fi was good, and now the Wi-Fi is a mouth.

"I'm eating," I say. "They have good bread." 

She nods, satisfied. She believes what I say because she wants to.

My sister glances off-screen, as if someone is there. "Is it safe there?" she asks, quieter.

"Yes," I say. The word lies easy. The djinn doesn't have to help. "I'm safe." 

My mother's eyes shift, catching the lattice for a half second before it settles. She squints, like she's trying to see past a screen. "Your eyes look strange," she says. "Is the light bad?" 

"The Wi-Fi is very good," I say, and the sentence makes no sense and all the sense in the world. The djinn brushes my tongue with approval. My sister frowns.

"Olivia," she says, carefully, "what does that mean?" 

I want to tell her everything. The words press against my teeth. The jade bead warms, trying to give me room. The hum rises, pushing back.

"I have to go," my mouth says. "Someone's at the door." 

"We love you," my mother says quickly, and I see a fear in her eyes that looks like mine.

"I love you," I say, and I mean it with a whole, unbroken piece of myself. Then the call ends. My finger didn't move.

I sit on the edge of the bed with my hands on my knees. The room is quiet, except for the network hum. The fountain's rhythm finds my pulse. The map on my screen glows.

On the Wi-Fi list, a new network appears beneath the premium one.

OLIVIADESIGNS-5G.

I blink, once, twice. The network isn't mine. It's broadcasting from my phone. The hotspot toggle is on, locked. Underneath the name is a small line of text: CONNECTED DEVICES: 3.

One of them is the laptop on my desk. Another is a device in the hallway, close enough to be outside my door. The third is somewhere in the courtyard.

The network isn't just in the walls now. It's in me. It is using me as a router.

I hear a knock. Soft, polite, inevitable. The doorknob turns.

"Olivia," Fatima's voice says from the hall. "It's time for sunset on the rooftop. The light is very good." 

The jade beads in my sleeve warm to almost painful. The countdown on my phone ticks on, steady and merciless. The hotspot keeps broadcasting.

I stand because my legs stand. I pick up my phone because my hand reaches. I go to the door because there is nowhere else to go.

The network follows.
