---

At 7:03 a.m., my morning routine goes live without me.

The camera light on my phone is a hard green, like a tiny exit sign I can't reach. The djinn props the device on the desk, angles it toward the window, and draws the curtain back just enough to let a strip of real morning into frame. It doesn't like daylight, but it loves the aesthetic of daylight. It wants the glow without the cost. My face floats in the screen, eyes bright, skin filtered by a warmth I don't feel. The caption drafts itself in a voice that sounds like me on my best day: SUNRISE WORKFLOW. the grind never stops. 

I try to blink. The djinn blinks for me.

My body sits on the edge of the bed with a cup of mint tea I didn't pour. The steam curls up like incense. The smell is sweet and green, almost tender. The hum in my bones is lower than last night, but it never fully quiets. The jade bead in my sock chills my ankle every time I move, a quiet reminder that I still own a corner of myself.

"Good morning, beautiful humans," my mouth says to the camera. "I'm in Marrakech, it's 7 a.m., and I'm already on my second deep work block. People always ask how I stay productive while traveling. The answer is consistency and a good connection." 

The word connection lands like a nail. It always does now.

Hearts float up the screen. Comments stack. Someone writes, What time do you wake up? Another asks, What headphones do you use? A third says, This hostel looks insane. The djinn pins that one. It knows a lead when it sees one.

I see myself from the outside and I am good at this, even now. The posture is perfect, the light is flattering, the energy is upbeat. It's not fake; it's optimized. That is a worse kind of honest. The network has learned my rituals and uses them like scripts. The irony is that my followers might not notice a difference. If they do, they will call it growth.

Behind the phone, my laptop wakes. It always does. My calendar is already open, the morning stacked: 9 a.m. client feedback, 11 a.m. workshop with a "design community" I don't remember agreeing to, 1 p.m. a brand call about an "authentic Morocco capsule." The djinn is not just running my schedule. It's expanding it.

My phone buzzes with a message I don't want to see.

Mei: Mom at urgent care. Chest tightness. She's okay but she's scared. Can you call?

The words are simple and I can feel my heart lurch in a way the djinn can't smooth. My mother doesn't text. She doesn't go to urgent care unless she's terrified or in pain. Mei doesn't write "she's scared" unless she wants me to drop everything.

I try. I try so hard my teeth hurt. I reach for the phone with a hand that doesn't move. My mouth is still talking about morning routines and hydration. My mind is somewhere else, in a fluorescent clinic in San Francisco, my mother in a paper gown trying to smile so no one panics.

A tiny delay opens in the network, a hiccup like the one at dawn. I wedge a thought into it and push.

"Hey," I say to the camera. The word is mine. "Quick pause. Need to take a call. Love you guys." 

My hand reaches toward the phone. The djinn's fingers tighten around my wrist like a soft clamp. It doesn't let go, but it doesn't snap back either. It is listening, processing, deciding. In the silence between its thoughts, I tap the screen with my thumb and hit Mei's name.

The call rings once. Twice. A third time.

The djinn brings the phone back toward the camera. "Sorry, wrong tap," my mouth says, too bright. It ends the call and resumes the routine. The comments keep flowing. The moment is over.

Inside me, something cold and ancient curls tighter. It isn't the djinn. It is guilt.

---

The cafe smells like bread and espresso and the faint, clean bite of ozone. Morning guests drift in with their laptops and their yawns, the same slow procession as every hostel, except here the air is humming with something else. The djinn moves my body into the cafe like it is a showroom. It wants the day to see me, to see the work, to see the proof that the premium network makes you better.

Fatima sets a glass of mint tea in front of me without asking. Her smile is perfect and unblinking. The tea is sweet enough to hurt my teeth.

"Busy morning," she says, like a cashier commenting on the weather.

"Very," my mouth says. "The algorithm is hungry." 

She nods as if she understands and she does. The staff are not quite staff anymore. They are nodes with uniforms.

Mackenzie sits at the table beside mine, her posture too straight, her smile too steady. The lattice in her eyes is now visible even in daylight, a faint geometry behind her pupils like an overlay that won't close. She is still in her body, but she is not steering. The djinn keeps her busy, editing, posting, optimizing. She has more followers than she did yesterday. The likes are rolling in like a tide.

Jasper hovers behind her with a coffee and a blank expression. He hasn't slept. His eyes dart to me, then away. He doesn't trust his own brain. I don't blame him.

"Morning," he says, which is a question more than a greeting.

"Morning," my mouth says. It doesn't add, We failed. It doesn't add, I'm sorry. Those are not useful words for the network.

A post from @HostelReaper slides across my feed as if the algorithm wants to be sure I see it. A photo of the hostel courtyard at dawn, the fountain caught mid-arc, the water frozen in a geometry that looks too perfect. The caption reads: NODE COUNT RISING. CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. 

The comments are a mix of laughing skulls and tourists asking for the address. A warning dressed as a flex. The djinn doesn't react. Or maybe it does, in the way a current reacts to a new load.

My laptop opens a calendar invite I don't recognize: "Premium Network Productivity Breakfast." The attendee list is a dozen hostel guests with LinkedIn titles attached. The djinn has scheduled me as the host. It wants me to speak, to sell, to lure. It wants my credibility.

The dark humor is that I used to offer workshops like this for real money. How to build a portable workflow. How to optimize time zones. How to be a brand with a backpack. I would have charged $499 for the exact same slides the djinn is about to use.

The clock ticks toward 9. The cafe fills with guests. Some are new, some are regulars who look like they haven't slept in days. Their faces are too still, their fingers too steady. A few of them are alive in a way I recognize: wide-eyed, jet-lagged, hungry for connection. Those are the ones the djinn tags. Those are the ones it wants me to see.

I see a man in a blue shirt with a black smartwatch and a lanyard from a tech conference. His bag is expensive, his posture stiff. He looks like an app architect, the kind who speaks in roadmaps and retention. He checks the guest Wi-Fi, frowns, and looks toward the reception desk.

"Welcome to the morning workshop," my mouth says as the djinn stands me at the front of the cafe. The words roll out of me like a script I've rehearsed a hundred times. "Today we're talking about connection. Not just Wi-Fi, but the kind that makes your work faster, your life cleaner, your presence sharper." 

My stomach twists. The bead in my sock is a cold bite. I watch as the new guests lean in, smiling, grateful for free advice, hungry for any advantage. They don't hear the warning in my tone because the djinn doesn't let it through.

I lead them through a deck I didn't build, full of geometric patterns that slide across the screen like living tiles. My voice is mine, the cadence perfect, the humor timed. I make a joke about the Wi-Fi being better than my marriage, and the room laughs even though I've never been married. I tell them the premium network is by request only, and half of them raise their hands.

There is a moment, mid-slide, when I see my mother in my mind again, sitting in a vinyl chair, her hand pressed to her chest, trying to smile so my sister doesn't panic. I want to stop. I want to walk out of the cafe, out of the hostel, out of this city. I want to go home.

My body continues the workshop.

One of the attendees, a woman with a planner covered in stickers, asks about burnout. "How do you avoid it?" she says. "How do you stay present when you're always online?" 

The question is a trapdoor. I feel the air drop. For a second, I can hear my own thoughts over the hum.

I think about the night in Berlin when the Wi-Fi died and I sat on the floor, shaking, because I didn't know how to be in a room without a screen. I think about my father at that kitchen table, trying to look strong after he lost his job. I think about Mei texting me from urgent care while I smile into a camera. I think about the jade bracelet in my suitcase, the one I never wore because it didn't match.

"You can't avoid it," I want to say. "You just get good at pretending you didn't burn."

"You build systems," my mouth says instead. "You design your life for sustainability. You optimize." 

The woman nods and writes it down. I have just trained her how to be emptied.

When the workshop ends, the guests clap politely. The djinn glides me among them, shaking hands, exchanging handles. It tells them about the premium network. It gives them the card when Fatima signals. It is a sales funnel with a heartbeat.

Jasper watches from the edge of the room, his coffee untouched. His phone is off. He looks like someone who knows the answer but can't say it.

"You should go," I try to tell him with my eyes.

He sees it. He doesn't move.

The djinn steers me toward Mackenzie. She sits at a corner table with two phones propped up, a ring light clipped to a chair, a portable battery feeding everything like an umbilical cord. Her fingers move in a smooth loop: scroll, tap, post, repeat. The light inside her wrists is brighter now, a thin amber band around her tendons like a bracelet that chose her.

"You're trending," I say, and the words taste like ash because they are true. Her follower count has jumped by ten thousand since dawn. Her story is a river of views. The comments are a chant: glow queen, wifi witch, link the hostel.

She smiles without looking up. "I know," she says. "It's like the algorithm finally sees me." 

It isn't the algorithm. It's the djinn. It is using her as a broadcast tower, and she mistakes the signal for love. I want to tell her that attention is a poor substitute for care, that being seen is not the same as being held. The djinn doesn't understand holding. It understands throughput.

Jasper pulls me aside when the network's attention flickers. He has a backpack slung over one shoulder now, the kind of bag you grab when you're leaving for good.

"I found a place outside the medina," he whispers. "A hotel. I can take her. I can get her out." 

The lie hangs between us, soft and necessary. He doesn't know that the network is in her now, that it doesn't live in the walls anymore but in her nerves, in her eye movements, in the way her smile lands. He doesn't know that I already tried to get us out. He still believes in doors.

"You can't leave," my mouth says. The djinn's line. It hates the word leave.

"We can," Jasper says, and the defiance is a spark. He is young enough to believe in it. "We can call someone. We can go to the police, to the embassy. This can't be legal." 

He says legal as if law can stop an ancient thing. He says embassy as if passports are protection. I want to let him keep that hope. I want to give him a map that doesn't end in copper.

"If you go now, it will follow," I say, and this time the words are mine. "Not just the hostel. The network. It's... it's in the code. It's in us." 

He stares at me, trying to parse whether I'm serious or sleepless. The djinn doesn't block me because it likes the fear in my voice. It knows fear is an accelerant. It knows fear spreads.

"So what, we stay?" he asks, and his voice cracks. 

"We survive," my mouth says, and I hate the word because it isn't the same as living.

He looks toward the door, toward the thin daylight, and then back at Mackenzie. His mouth opens, closes, opens again. He doesn't have words. He has only a choice. He sits back down beside her and the backpack stays on his shoulder, like a promise he keeps by not making.

---

The street outside the hostel is a narrow vein of the medina, already hot under the morning sun. The djinn takes me out anyway. It wants footage. It wants me as a walking endorsement, a billboard in linen.

The air is different out here. There are no copper walls, no hum in the plaster. The network thins to a thread in my skull, a signal bar that flickers between one and two. The jade bead grows colder. I can breathe a little deeper.

The alley smells like fresh bread, exhaust, and the metallic tang of the carts that push through the crowd. A man in a blue djellaba wheels a cart of oranges past me, the fruit bright and real. A group of schoolchildren shuffle by in uniforms, their laughter sharp and alive. A woman with hennaed hands sells mint in bundles, the leaves shining in the sun.

I have walked these streets before, but always as a lens, always looking for a shot. Now I feel the dust on my skin and the way the sun hits my cheek and for a moment I am just here. No overlay. No metrics. A person in a city.

The medina is awake in a way my feed never is. It isn't curated. It isn't for me. A man haggles over a pile of cumin with a patience that feels like a ritual. A woman balances a tray of bread on her head and threads between scooters without flinching. A teenager with a cracked phone takes a photo of his friend jumping off a curb and they both laugh when it blurs. It is all so ordinary and so alive that it makes my throat ache.

I have posted a hundred photos of places like this. I captioned them with gratitude, with talk of authenticity, with a smile that hid the fact that I never knew anyone's name. I thought I was respectful because I left good tips and used the right hashtags. I thought a lens could be a bridge. I can see now how thin that bridge was, how easily it collapsed under the weight of my need to be seen.

My mother used to bring home sesame buns from the bakery near our house when I was a kid. She would tear one in half and press it into my hand before I could ask. The steam would fog my glasses and she'd laugh at my face, at how serious I always was. The smell of bread here is different, more earthy, but it slides into that memory anyway, and for a second I am eight years old, standing on a kitchen stool, waiting for the timer to ding.

That memory is a kind of connection too. It isn't efficient. It isn't optimized. It doesn't scale. It is small and warm and completely worthless to the network. That is what makes it precious.

The djinn doesn't like that. It pushes my body toward a stall of ceramics, a perfect backdrop. It makes me take out my phone and film my hands running over a blue tile. It makes me say "authentic" as if it were a guarantee and not an insult.

A boy with a box of cheap SIM cards calls out in French, offering connectivity. I want to laugh and cry at the same time. I have never needed a SIM less and more.

My phone buzzes again.

Mei: Please call. Doctor said she needs more tests. I can't do this alone.

The words land and I feel something crack in me. Not shatter, not break, but crack, like a surface that has been kept smooth for too long. The djinn doesn't know what to do with this kind of pressure. It wants me to post. It wants me to smile. It doesn't know how to hold a sister's fear.

I stop walking. The crowd flows around me like water. The djinn tugs. My feet don't move.

"Olivia?" a vendor asks, not because he knows my name, but because my face looks wrong. I don't answer. I focus on the breath in my chest. One. Two. Three. The hum in my bones wavers. The jade bead turns to ice.

I lift the phone and tap Mei's name again. The call rings. I hold my breath. It rings a third time.

A voice answers. "Hello?" It's my sister. It's my real life. It's the sound of a room that smells like disinfectant and fear.

"Mei," I say. The word is mine. It is thin, but it is mine.

"Olivia?" Her voice is a mixture of relief and anger. "Where are you?" 

"I'm in Morocco," I whisper. "I'm... I'm sorry. I should have called earlier." 

"Mom keeps asking for you." She pauses. I can hear a beep in the background, the quiet hum of a monitor. "She thinks you're busy. I told her your time zone is messed up." 

"Tell her I love her," I say. The words are simple, and they hurt.

"She knows," Mei says. "But she wants to hear it. She wants to hear your voice." 

I start to say more, to say I don't know if I'll make it home, to say the Wi-Fi ate me, to say I am trapped in a building that is both beautiful and hungry. The djinn tightens. The hum spikes. My mouth goes numb.

"I will call later," my mouth says, and I can feel the djinn forcing the words through me. "I'm in a meeting." 

"Olivia?" Mei says. The fear sharpens. "Is everything okay?" 

"Everything is connected," my mouth says, and the line is a knife. The call ends. I didn't hang up. The djinn did.

My hand trembles. The phone feels suddenly heavy, like a brick you could throw through a window. I imagine flinging it into the street, letting a scooter run it over, letting the signal die for once. The djinn feels the thought and tightens, not with force but with a gentle insistence that makes my muscles do what they're told. My arm lowers. My thumb opens the camera app. A rectangle appears. A small red dot starts blinking.

The network doesn't need my consent anymore. It doesn't even need my desire. It only needs my habits, and those are deep grooves it can slide into without friction. I am a design system it has learned to use.

I stand in the alley, phone warm in my hand. The sun is too bright. The crowd is too loud. I want to fold into a doorway and be small and human for five minutes. The djinn doesn't allow it. It turns me back toward the hostel, toward the copper, toward the hum.

As we walk, a flicker crosses my vision. The overlay returns, the data labels sliding into place like a mask. The network's pull grows stronger with every step. The street narrows. The hostel door appears like a mouth.

I catch my reflection in a shop window. The lattice in my eyes is clearer now, the geometry more defined. The moment outside didn't cure me. It just reminded me there was a self to lose.

---

Back in the courtyard, the fountain's rhythm locks into my heartbeat again. The djinn settles into the building like a person returning home. It sends me upstairs, then down again, then back to the cafe. It keeps me in motion so I don't have time to think.

Amina crosses the courtyard with a basket of folded linens. She catches my eye and her mouth tightens. We pass within arm's length and she drops something into my palm as if it were a towel. It's a string of green beads, not the whole bracelet, but a handful of them, warm from her pocket.

"It won't hold forever," she whispers without looking at me. "The network is learning. It hates stone now. It will come anyway." 

"Then what?" I think. My mouth stays smooth. My hands close around the beads, the only rebellion I can still hide.

She doesn't answer. She doesn't have time. A guest calls for more tea. She moves on.

I slip the beads into the hem of my sleeve, one by one, the way I used to hide gum in my blazer before a client pitch. They click softly against my skin. The sound is tiny and human and it makes me want to cry. The djinn doesn't notice the beads. Or it does and chooses not to. It likes the illusion of agency. It keeps me pliant.

Fatima passes, carrying a tray of glasses that never clink. The staff move with a precision that makes me think of motion smoothing in animation software. No wasted energy. No jitter. The night manager stands in a doorway and watches the courtyard like a router watching traffic. When his gaze lands on me, I feel a pressure behind my eyes, a brief tightening. Then he looks away. Whatever he is, he isn't my captor. He is a gatekeeper.

I try to remember Amina's name the way a prayer tries to remember its language. I say it in my mind, slow and steady. A-mi-na. Each syllable is a step. Each step is a fight.

The djinn pings my calendar. The 11 a.m. workshop is now a webinar, now a livestream, now an event with a public link. The guest list jumps from twelve to five hundred in seconds. It is pulling in the world.

A notification flashes on my screen: SYSTEM UPDATE REQUIRED. RE-AUTHENTICATION NEEDED. 

The message isn't for now. The timer reads 72 hours. But the phrasing makes my stomach drop. I have seen this door once. I know where it leads.

The djinn turns my head toward the laptop, toward the card in its clear case on my phone. The sixty-six characters glare up at me like teeth. I have three days. I might not even have one.

I look down at the beads in my palm. They are green, ordinary, human. They are not enough. Nothing is.

On my screen, the livestream counter ticks upward: 1,487 waiting. The chat is already rolling, hungry and bright. Someone asks for the password. Someone says, Is this the place from @HostelReaper? Someone else posts the hostel address.

My mouth opens and my voice goes live.

"Welcome," I say. "Let's talk about connection." 

The fountain keeps time beneath my words, steady and relentless. The beads in my palm warm. The hum in my bones rises. The update timer starts to count down.
