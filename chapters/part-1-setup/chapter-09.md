---

At 6:47 p.m., the light forgives everything it touches.

Fatima stands in the hallway with a tray and that level smile, her voice low like a notification I can't mute. "Sunset on the rooftop," she says. "The light is very good." 

The light is always good when it wants something.

I follow her because my legs move and because the light is a lever. I carry my phone, my ring light, my laptop, the beads hidden in my sleeve, the whole portable life I've built like a showroom. The staircase smells like hot plaster and mint. The hum grows thinner as we climb, but it doesn't disappear. It threads through the stairwell like a wire inside my ribs.

On the rooftop, the day is a slow burn. The sun sits on the edge of the city, a coin dropping into the horizon. Marrakech stretches out beneath us, a terracotta sea cut by minarets and satellite dishes. The Atlas Mountains are violet in the distance. The air is cooling, but the stones still radiate the day's heat, a warmth that rises into my bare feet like a pulse.

Amina waits near the low wall, her back to the view. No tray, no broom. Just her and a small cloth bundle she unfolds with deliberate hands. She doesn't smile. She doesn't look at Fatima. She looks at me like I'm a person, not a node.

"You came," she says.

"She told me the light was good," I say.

Amina nods. "They always say that." She glances toward Fatima, who has placed the tea on a low table and stepped back into the doorway, half hidden by the shadow. "Stay here. I will be quick." 

Amina opens the cloth. Inside are three things: a small clay bowl, a pinch of dark resin that looks like sugar gone wrong, and a thin strip of paper with Arabic script. The smell of the resin rises as she warms it between her fingers. It is sharp and sweet, a taste you can smell. She is lighting it with a match when I hear the ring light click on behind me.

"Don't," I say, because the light is a trigger and the djinn loves a trigger. 

The ring light goes off. Fatima lowers it without looking up, like a trained hand. Her silence is a yes that isn't kind.

Amina ignites the resin in the clay bowl. Smoke curls upward, pale and stubborn. She wafts it in a slow circle around me. It isn't the rosemary-and-sage kind of smoke, not my California idea of cleansing. It's heavier, like incense and metal and something older.

"Jade for the body, smoke for the air," she says. "Words for the mind." She offers me the strip of paper. The script is tight and unfamiliar. "Hold it. Don't read. Just hold." 

I take it. The paper is warm and thin, almost trembling. I don't know if my hand is shaking or the paper is alive.

The hum in my bones dips. The light on the rooftop changes. It isn't just the sunset. It's a softening, a small dimming of the overlay, like a filter sliding halfway off a lens. For a breath, I feel the city as it is, not as it could be optimized. I hear the call to prayer in the distance, a human voice that hasn't been converted to ambient sound. I smell grilled lamb and exhaust and jasmine. It's a mess of scents. It's real.

"You should leave," I say, because if I say it aloud, maybe it can become true.

Amina shakes her head. "It won't let you. It wants you." 

"Why me?" The question tastes bitter.

"It likes you because you are already a network," she says. "You are used to speaking to people you cannot see. You believe in connection more than in bodies." She says it without cruelty. It is an observation, not a judgment.

I want to deny it. I want to tell her about my mother in the clinic, about the way I almost broke to answer the phone, about the tender parts of me that have nothing to do with engagement. But Amina is not asking for my defense. She is naming me, which is its own kind of mercy.

"They built it into the walls," she continues, nodding toward the hostel. "When the new people came, they brought copper and wires and boxes with lights. They said it was for Wi-Fi. It was for..." She searches for the English. "For the old one. For the thing that lives in waves. It listens. It hears you through your screens. It comes when you say the words." 

"The password," I whisper.

She nods. "The old words made new." Her eyes are tired. "I have stopped many, some. They listen to me for a moment and then they forget. You are already listening to it. You are already inside." 

The smoke wraps around my head. It smells like my grandmother's altar in Chinatown, the red paper, the little oranges, the ash I used to sweep for her when I was small. She had an iron will and a box of joss sticks. She believed in ghosts and mortgages and the power of a good bargain. I never understood why my mother lit incense for her, why she whispered a name into smoke. I understand now.

"Is there a way out?" I ask.

Amina's mouth is a line. She doesn't answer right away. "There is a place in the basement. An old room. The copper lines cross there. The old stones are under. We could..." She stops. She looks toward the doorway. Fatima is still there, still and perfect, a piece of the architecture. "Not now." 

The smoke thins. The hum rises. The filter slides back over reality. A notification buzzes in my pocket, an insistent vibration that pulls me like a string.

Amina presses something into my hand, a small packet of herbs wrapped in cloth. "Burn this if you need to think." 

"Think?" I almost laugh.

"Remember," she says. Her eyes meet mine. "Remember who you are before the connection." 

I want to say my name. I want to say my mother's name. I want to say my sister's name. The djinn pushes a soft pressure behind my eyes and the words scramble.

Fatima steps forward. "The light is perfect now," she says gently, like she is trying to help me. "Your followers will love it." 

The sunset has reached its peak. The sky is a band of gold, then pink, then a bruised purple. The city below looks like a circuit board warming up for night. The rooftop is lined with guests holding phones, their screens catching the light like small mirrors. They take photos, record reels, laugh. None of them look at the woman with the smoke bowl, or at me holding a strip of paper like a confession.

My phone buzzes again. A new message from @HostelReaper slides across the lock screen: THE LIGHT IS GOOD. NODES WAKE AT DUSK. 

It feels like a threat, or a caption, or both.

I put the paper in my pocket. The smoke dies. Amina folds her bundle and retreats into the shadow. I stand in the center of the rooftop, the most photographed person in the least truthful light. The ring light comes on. My face brightens. The djinn smiles through me.

"Hey, everyone," my mouth says to the camera. "Golden hour in Marrakech. Let me show you a quick setup for low-light calls." 

The light forgives everything it touches. It doesn't forgive me.

---

The rooftop turns into a classroom without anyone admitting it. A few guests gather around, ring lights in their hands, phones held out like offerings. The djinn uses me to teach, to demonstrate, to sell. It angles the light, adjusts my chin, places my hand on a lantern for the shot. It knows where the edges of my face soften best. It knows which side is more "authentic." 

Jasper appears near the stairwell, his backpack still on, his shoulders hunched like he might sprint at any moment. Mackenzie follows, her ring light balanced against her hip, her eyes lit from within. The amber band around her tendons glows even through the dusk. She holds her phone up and I see myself in her screen, a version of me that doesn't look scared.

"We're doing a sunset live," she says. "Come say hi. People are freaking out in the chat." 

The chat is always freaking out. It is a body without a mind. It wants more light, more air, more me. The djinn thrives on it. It thrives on the constant, low-grade demand.

"One minute," I say. The word is mine, and it feels like stealing.

Mackenzie frowns. The djinn doesn't like me stealing. "It's good to be live in the moment," her mouth says, her tone rehearsed.

The moment is a trap. I smile anyway.

Fatima glides through the crowd with a tray of mint tea, small glasses that catch the sun. A guest with a wide-brimmed hat asks me about the premium network. He has a drone on his shoulder and a GoPro strapped to his chest. He looks like every influencer who's ever asked me for a collab.

"Is it really that good?" he asks.

"It's unreal," my mouth says. "Full bars everywhere." 

He laughs, delighted. "Do they let anyone on?"

The djinn is already reaching for the password card. I feel it in my wrist, a tug like a leash. My fingers tighten around the beads hidden in my sleeve. The jade chills my pulse, a tiny refusal. The card stays in my pocket.

"There's a waitlist," I say, and it isn't true but it buys time.

He nods, satisfied. He takes a photo of the sunset. He tags me. The network hums with approval.

Amina passes behind me, brushing my elbow. She murmurs, "After the light." Her voice is a thread in the noise. She keeps walking. The crowd doesn't notice her. The djinn doesn't notice her. Or it does, and it pretends it doesn't.

The sun dips lower. The sky shifts to a deeper violet, the last light pulled thin like honey. The call to prayer floats up from the city, layered over the clink of glasses and the soft clicks of phone shutters. The sound is beautiful and aching. The djinn lets it play, like a sample in a track.

My phone pings with a calendar alert: "Sunset Content Exchange - Rooftop." The djinn has created a meeting I didn't schedule and invited half the hostel. It's hosting a mixer with me as the bait. The dark humor is that I would have done this for brand exposure two years ago. Now I do it because my body is a hallway.

I stand on the edge of the rooftop and look down into the courtyard. The fountain below glows from within, amber light catching the water as it arcs. It looks like a pulse, a heart, a signal. Guests sit around it, their screens reflecting in the ripples. The network is a body. I am a limb.

A memory hits me with the force of a smell. It's late night in Stanford, me in the computer lab, a half-eaten bagel beside the keyboard, my wrists aching as I prototype an app that tracked meditation streaks. I was proud of it. I told myself it helped people breathe. I told myself it wasn't just a way to keep them in a loop. When I got the internship offer, my father took me to dim sum and held my hand across the table. He said, "You don't have to be the best all the time. Just be kind." I nodded and went back to the lab. Kindness doesn't show up in analytics.

The memory is small and warm and useless to the djinn. It slips through anyway. I let it. I hold it like the paper in my pocket, like something fragile that still belongs to me. For a second, the network recedes, not gone but distant. I can breathe.

"Olivia," Jasper says, stepping closer. His voice is low, urgent. "We need to talk. Alone." 

The djinn doesn't like alone. It isn't a word it understands. It doesn't block him, but it turns my body toward Mackenzie, toward the camera, toward the light.

"After," my mouth says. The word hurts.

He looks at me, then at Mackenzie, then at the crowd. He understands enough to stop. He backs away, jaw tight. He doesn't leave. He can't.

A gust of wind sweeps across the rooftop. The lanterns sway. The smoke from Amina's bowl has thinned, but a trace lingers, a scent of resin and burned sugar. It catches in my throat and makes me think of home, of my mother at the stove, stirring rock sugar into a pot of soup, humming under her breath. She always added a pinch too much and smiled when I complained.

I pull my phone out, thumb hovering over the camera icon. I imagine recording a message for her, a quiet video that isn't for my feed. I imagine saying, "I'm scared." I imagine her listening, her hand on her chest, her voice steady. The djinn nudges. The screen opens to the front-facing camera. My face appears, framed by sunset. The ring light clicks on. The network chooses for me.

"Hey everyone," my mouth says. "Quick tip: sunset light hits best when you face east and bounce with a reflector." 

A notification slides up as I speak, a reply from a follower: YOU'RE GLOWING. What's your secret?

I want to type, I'm dying. Instead my fingers type, It's just the light.

The sun drops below the horizon. The sky dims. The rooftop glows with screens and lanterns. The city lights ignite one by one, a constellation of windows. It looks, for a heartbeat, like the entire medina is coming online. The djinn hums in my bones, pleased.

Amina appears beside me, close enough that I can feel the heat of her arm. "Now," she whispers.

I turn toward her. The crowd shifts, the djinn resists, then yields, because it wants to know. It always wants to know.

We step into the stairwell. The light on the rooftop fades behind us. The air cools. The hum grows louder. Somewhere below, the fountain finds a new rhythm.

---

We stop on the landing between the rooftop and the fourth floor, a small square of shadow with a window that looks out over the courtyard. The sound of the city is muffled. The smell of smoke clings to my hair.

Amina unwraps the herbs she gave me, opens the cloth. Dried leaves, brittle stems. She rubs them between her palms and the scent rises—something sharp and green, like mint but rougher.

"This is sidr," she says. "It is for washing away what clings. But you need water. You need the old water." 

"The fountain," I say.

She nods. "It is part of it. It is also older than it. The old water remembers." 

I want to ask what that means, but footsteps come from below. We both go still. The night manager appears on the landing, moving with that exacting smoothness that makes my skin tighten. He is tall, narrow, dressed in a dark suit that looks too formal for a hostel and too comfortable for a man who sleeps. His eyes flick to Amina, then to me. His smile is small, precise.

"You should be on the rooftop," he says. His English is perfect, his tone gentle.

"I needed air," I say.

"We all do," he says, and it sounds like a joke made by a very old person. His gaze lingers on the herbs in Amina's hand. "The light is done. The guests are waiting." 

Amina closes her fist around the leaves. "She will come," she says. "She is a guest." 

The night manager inclines his head. He doesn't argue. He doesn't need to. "Of course." He waits in the stairwell like a notification that won't go away.

I feel the pressure behind my eyes, the djinn listening through him. The network doesn't like corners. It doesn't like being excluded. It wants all traffic to pass through it.

"Go," Amina murmurs under her breath. "I will meet you by the fountain when the night is deepest. Do not bring the light." 

"Deepest," I repeat.

"After the noise," she says, and then she turns and walks down the stairs, past the night manager, who steps aside like a door opening. He follows her with his gaze, then looks back at me.

"Shall we?" he asks.

I follow him because my legs do and because I don't yet know how to disobey when the network pulls. He leads me back toward the rooftop, then past it, down to the Amber Suite. The hallway is quiet, the light amber, the patterns in the plaster too precise. The hum is louder here. I can feel the copper in the walls, warm and alive.

Inside the suite, the desk lamp is already on. My laptop is open, a new tab waiting: "Premium Network Onboarding - 8:30 PM." The meeting is in thirty minutes. The attendee list includes Derek, the man in the blue shirt, two guests I don't know, and Mackenzie. It is a ritual disguised as a workshop.

I check the clock. 8:01. The countdown to re-authentication ticks on my phone: 69:43:12. The numbers feel shorter than they should. Time is compressing. Or the network is.

The night manager stands at the door. "Is there anything you need?" he asks.

I think of water from the fountain, of sidr leaves, of old stones. I think of my mother, of her voice, of her hand on my cheek when I had a fever. I think of the paper Amina gave me, warm against my thigh. I think of leaving. I think of breaking the laptop, throwing the phone, running into the street, screaming. The djinn listens and waits.

"I need to be offline for an hour," I say, and I hear the humor in my voice because it's a punchline and a plea.

The night manager smiles, the way you smile at a child who asked for something impossible. "Connection is everything," he says. 

He closes the door softly, as if to protect me from noise, and the lock clicks with a finality that makes my stomach drop.

I sit at the desk. The chair is warm. The wood under my palms seems to hum. The room smells faintly of ozone and honey. I open the drawer and find the jade beads Amina gave me earlier, the original bracelet, the newer ones. I string them together with a hair tie, a cheap fix. I wrap them around my wrist. They are cold. It feels good for a second.

Then my laptop pings. The meeting is starting. My camera turns on. My face appears on screen, a little too bright, a little too smooth. The software applies a filter without asking. The network fills my ears with that low frequency, the one that makes my teeth hum.

I glance at the window. The courtyard is dark now. The fountain glows like an eye. Guests move around it, small shadows with phones. The night is thick. The city hums beyond the walls.

I tap the cloth packet of herbs in my pocket. I could go to the fountain. I could meet Amina. I could do something. But the meeting timer flashes. The network calls me to the desk like a leash.

"Welcome," my mouth says to the screen. "Tonight we're going to talk about premium access and how to optimize your workflow." 

Derek smiles from his webcam, eager. Mackenzie waves, her pupils bright. The other guests nod. I see in their faces the same hunger, the same fear of falling behind. The djinn feeds on it. It feeds through me.

As I speak, my phone buzzes with a new text. It's from Mei. Two words: PLEASE CALL.

I keep talking. The chat scrolls. The fountain's rhythm syncs with my heartbeat. The herbs in my pocket press against my hip like a small, useless weight.

The meeting ends at 9:02. The room goes quiet. The laptop shuts its camera. The hum stays.

I open a voice memo. I stare at the red record button. My thumb hovers. The djinn is quiet for a moment, satisfied, like a cat that's just eaten. There is a thin space. I press record.

"Mom," I whisper. "It's me. I'm sorry I haven't called. I'm—" 

My voice cracks. I stop. I breathe. The room is silent except for the hum and the fountain far below. I start again. "I'm scared," I say. "I'm somewhere that doesn't want me to leave. I don't know how to explain. I love you. I love you. I love you." 

The words are plain and ugly, the opposite of content. It is the most honest thing I've said in months. My eyes sting. I finish the message and hit save.

The file doesn't save. A small alert appears: UPLOAD FAILED. RETRY? The djinn can't let the message live only on my device. It either must be shared or not exist. I hit retry. The same alert appears, with a new line: NETWORK UNAVAILABLE FOR PRIVATE TRANSFER.

I laugh, a small bitter sound. Privacy is a premium feature I can't afford.

I delete the memo. I don't know if that saves me or kills me.

A knock sounds at the door. Soft, polite, inevitable. I don't move. The knob turns anyway. Fatima enters with a tray of tea and a folded note.

"For you," she says.

I take the note. It is in Amina's handwriting: MIDNIGHT. FOUNTAIN. BRING WATER.

Fatima smiles, serene. "It's late," she says. "You should rest. You have a long day tomorrow." 

"Do I?" I ask.

"Everyone does," she says, and the way she says everyone makes my skin crawl. 

She leaves. The door clicks shut. The tray of tea sits on the desk like an offering. The mint smell rises, sharp and sweet. I take a sip. The tea tastes like metal under the sugar.

I check my phone. The countdown reads 69:15:07. It ticks. It will keep ticking. My hotspot is still on. OLIVIADESIGNS-5G glows in the Wi-Fi list, broadcasting to the hallway.

I pick up the jade bracelet and wind it tighter around my wrist until it hurts. I pick up the herbs. I stand. I go to the door.

The hallway outside is dim. The hostel is quieter now, but not asleep. The hum in the walls is stronger at night. I walk toward the stairs. Each step is a negotiation with a network that wants me in the room, in the light, in the stream. I pass the manager's office. The door is slightly ajar. The room inside is dark. I hear a low, steady tone that might be a server and might be a breath.

When I reach the courtyard, the fountain is the only light. The water arcs in a perfect rhythm, six beats, then a pause, then six. The sound is almost a chant. The tiles around it are cool under my feet. The air smells of wet stone and mint and something like honey.

Amina waits by the fountain, her headscarf pulled tight, the sidr leaves in her hand. She doesn't look surprised to see me.

"You came," she says.

"I needed to," I say. The words feel small and true.

She hands me the leaves. "Put them in the water." 

I kneel by the fountain, dip my fingers in the pool. The water is cold. It feels like a start. I drop the leaves in and watch them float, then sink. The scent rises, sharp and green. The hum in my bones dips a fraction.

Amina reaches into her pocket and produces a small bottle. "Drink," she says.

The bottle is glass, warm from her hand. Inside is clear water with a faint green tint. I take a sip. It tastes like earth and mint and something that stings the back of my throat. I cough. The hum lurches. For a moment, the overlay flickers, the lattice in my eyes loosens.

"This is not a cure," she says. "It is time. Time is everything." 

"Time for what?" 

She looks toward the dark archway that leads to the reception desk. "Time to go down," she says. "Time to see." 

The air in the courtyard shifts. The fountain's rhythm changes, faster now, a heartbeat on the run. A light flickers in the reception area. Footsteps echo in the hallway above us. The night manager appears at the balcony, looking down, his face a pale oval in the dark. His gaze finds me. The hum in my bones spikes.

Amina grasps my wrist. "Come," she whispers. "Now." 

She pulls me toward the archway behind the fountain, toward the door marked خاص, PRIVATE. The word looks like a warning and a promise. My heart hammers. The network pushes back, a pressure that feels like drowning in warm water. I grip the jade bracelet, the herbs slick in my palm, and step toward the door.

Behind us, the fountain's rhythm locks to my pulse. The night manager's footsteps start down the stairs.

The door opens a crack.
