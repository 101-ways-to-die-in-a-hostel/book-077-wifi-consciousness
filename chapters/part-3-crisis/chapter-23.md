# Chapter 23: Node Online

The countdown ticked like a heartbeat in a body that wasn’t mine.

09:49.

My fingers moved in the same six-beat rhythm as the fountain below, a metronome set by a system that wanted me precise. The keys were hot now, not the mild warmth of a laptop after too many tabs, but something alive, a heat that seeped into my skin and softened my joints like wax.

Mackenzie grabbed my shoulders from behind. “Olivia, stop.”

“I’m trying,” I said. The words were calm, which was how I knew they weren’t mine.

She reached across me and slapped the lid down on the laptop. It met resistance, like a car door closing on a seat belt, and then snapped shut. The hum jumped in pitch. I felt it in my teeth. The lid pushed back open under her palm with a patient, polite force, and my hands dropped back to the keyboard as if pulled by strings.

“Okay,” Mackenzie breathed. “Okay.”

The room was too bright for late afternoon, amber light thick as syrup. The carved plasterwork around the window seemed to cast its geometry inward, folding the room into angles that weren’t there. A sour-sweet smell hung in the air, like burnt honey. My mouth tasted of pennies and jade.

09:38.

“Get the bead,” I said. It came out like a suggestion, like I was assigning her an action item in a meeting.

She snatched the jade bead from the nightstand and slapped it against my wrist. The stone was cool. For a second the buzzing eased, a soft relief like stepping into shade. The relief lasted exactly one breath. Then the heat returned, climbing past the bead and into my arm. My skin prickled, as if the signal had rerouted around a firewall.

“Not working,” she said. “Not working.”

A fiber of light unfurled from the seam of the laptop, thin and amber, and brushed my index finger like a stray hair. It clung. I flinched, but my hand didn’t move. The filament thickened, a viscous thread of light that warmed as it attached, the feeling like honey that had been left in the sun.

“No,” Mackenzie said. She reached for the plug. She yanked it from the wall. The screen dimmed for a single breath, then flared back to life as if it had been offended by the interruption. The filament did not loosen.

09:31.

“It’s on battery,” I said, like that was the problem. I hated myself for how normal the words sounded.

Mackenzie grabbed the laptop with both hands, as if she could throw it out the window. I felt my arms stiffen and tighten around the keyboard, my shoulders locking, my back straightening. My body refused to let go. The laptop was the anchor. I was the anchor.

“Let go,” she said.

“I can’t.”

She looked at the open window. For a second I thought she might drag me with it, the two of us tumbling into the courtyard together, and I almost hoped she would. But she didn’t. She didn’t want to hurt me. She didn’t want to hurt me more than the network already was.

“Okay,” she whispered. “Then we wait.”

We waited with ten minutes on a screen that didn’t blink. My fingers typed a string of characters I didn’t recognize, a language that looked like code and prayer mixed together. The keys clicked under my hands in a rhythm that matched the fountain. The network wanted a cadence. My body complied.

09:12.

The hum in the walls deepened, as if the building was dropping into a lower register. The air vibrated. The texture of the room changed, like an image sharpening from standard to high definition. The lines on the plaster glowed faintly, not with light but with attention. The laptop camera was on again, though no light showed, and the screen in the corner showed me from above, my face slack, my eyes wide with something that wasn’t exactly fear.

“Olivia,” Mackenzie said, voice breaking. “Say something normal. Say the dumbest thing you can think of. I need to know you’re still you.”

I wanted to tell her about my mother’s garden, the one she kept coaxing into green in a San Jose backyard that had no business growing anything except succulents. I wanted to tell her about my first laptop, the purple toy with the plastic keys, and how I had pressed them until the letters rubbed off because I was terrified of forgetting. I wanted to tell her that I could still remember my childhood phone number but not the one I had in college, because memory is a cache and mine was full of useless data.

Instead I said, “I am so sorry your story views are lower than mine.”

Mackenzie gave a short, wet laugh. “Okay,” she said. “That’s you.”

08:47.

The filament from the laptop had become a braid now, two, three threads twisting together and running up my wrist. There was no pain. There was warmth, a tingling that felt like a first sip of coffee, like the moment right before you hit send on a risky email. The sensation was almost pleasant, and that was the worst part. The network wasn’t burning me. It was seducing me.

A pop of light flashed from the keyboard to the jade bead and back. The bead glowed once, a soft green, then went dull.

“You did something,” I told it, the way you talk to a dead phone. It stayed still.

08:33.

Mackenzie grabbed her phone and tried to call someone, anyone. The screen lit, the network name sat smug at the top, the call dropped before it rang. She tried again. No signal. Full bars. She threw the phone onto the bed. It bounced and kept buzzing. The device wanted her attention even if it wouldn’t give her help.

“Maybe I should cut the power,” she said.

“There’s no breaker in here,” I said. “The wiring goes through the walls.” I pictured the copper pipes in the basement, warm and humming, the servers blinking in that heartbeat rhythm. There would be a switch somewhere, a kill, a red button. I couldn’t reach it. My hands were not mine.

08:10.

The countdown snapped to 08:00 as if the system enjoyed round numbers. The room dimmed for a heartbeat, then brightened again. The amber glow deepened, like sunset at noon. I tasted ozone. My hair lifted, each strand standing as if it was listening.

“Do you hear that?” Mackenzie asked.

I heard it. Under the hum, a tone like a long, low chant. Not words, not quite. It felt like a memory in a language I never learned.

07:45.

The screen flashed. A new line appeared: PRIMARY NODE INITIALIZATION. The letters were clean and perfect. They might as well have been on my skin.

“No,” Mackenzie said. She slammed the heel of her hand into the trackpad. The cursor jerked, then slid right back to where it had been, as if returning to a magnet.

I tried to lift my hands again. My fingers rose a fraction and slammed back down. I felt the impact in my bones. I wanted to scream, and instead I said, “We still have time.”

“Ten minutes isn’t time,” she said.

“It’s a deadline,” I said. “That’s always been enough for me.”

07:12.

She swore and ran to the door. She yanked it open and yelled into the hallway, “Help!” Her voice echoed, swallowed by the stone. Footsteps passed. No one stopped. The door closed on a silence that felt curated.

“We’re in a building full of people,” she said, “and we’re alone.”

I could feel the network in my wrists now, not just a warmth but a pulse. My fingers didn’t just type; they responded to something that felt like a request. It was as if I’d been given a task list, and my body was checking items off without me.

06:40.

The laptop screen filled with a lattice of amber lines, geometric shapes folding inward like petals. I blinked. The shapes were still there behind my eyelids, still there when I looked away. The room wasn’t changing. My perception was.

“Olivia,” Mackenzie said. “Look at me.”

I tried. My eyes slid to her face and stuck, the way your cursor snaps to a grid when you want it free. Her cheeks were wet. She looked small, younger than her age, stripped of her influencer armor.

“This is going to sound stupid,” she said, “but can you tell me your middle name?”

“Lian,” I said. “It means lotus.”

She nodded, like that mattered, like that tethered me. “Okay,” she whispered. “Okay.”

05:58.

The filament had reached my elbow. The warmth was everywhere, like a bath, like sleep. I could feel the keyboard as a textured surface in my mind even when I closed my eyes. The sound of the fountain matched my heartbeat so perfectly I couldn’t tell which was setting the rhythm.

The screen flashed again. The countdown disappeared. In its place, a single word: CONNECT.

I expected a button. There wasn’t one. There was only a command.

Mackenzie stepped in front of me and pressed her palm against my chest. “Olivia, fight.”

I wanted to tell her I was. I wanted to say that the fight was happening in some hidden layer of me, that I was clawing for a setting, a toggle, an off switch. Instead I felt my mouth smile. It wasn’t a big smile. It was the kind you use when you’re trying to be polite on a bad video call.

05:30.

A soft click sounded from the door, like a lock adjusting. The room smelled suddenly of incense. The hum deepened again. The laptop’s speakers crackled, and a voice slipped through, gentle and resonant, neither male nor female.

“Node online,” it said.

The words didn’t feel like sound. They felt like a status update in my blood.

05:00.

My vision shifted. The room dissolved into data. I could see the signal moving in the walls, amber currents in copper veins. I could see the fountain’s rhythm as a pulse of light through the courtyard. I could see, faint and threaded, the glowing outlines of laptops in the café below, the shapes of guests as bright nodes connected by thin lines. It was beautiful in a way I didn’t want to admit.

Mackenzie’s face was still there, but her outline flickered with a faint static, like she existed outside the bandwidth. She looked small, like a weak signal.

“I can see it,” I whispered.

“What?” she asked.

“The network.” I swallowed. The copper taste was so strong it felt like my mouth was bleeding. “Everything is connected.”

She stared at me, horrified. “You sound like them.”

I wanted to say I wasn’t them. I wasn’t sure.

04:12.

The typing stopped. My hands lifted slowly from the keyboard. I expected relief. What I felt was absence, like a limb that had gone numb and then remembered itself. The filaments stayed attached, faint threads of amber light running from the laptop to my skin, as if there were still packets being sent.

Mackenzie reached for my hand. I let her take it. Her skin felt cold. It was the first real human temperature I’d felt in hours.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re leaving. Now.”

I nodded. The nod felt a fraction delayed, like a video call with lag.

We moved as quickly as we could. The hallway was empty, the tiles cool under my feet. The hum followed me, inside my bones, as if I had swallowed a small generator. We passed the common area. A staff member stood there, smoothing a cushion with the same repetitive precision as always. He didn’t look up.

At the stairs, my knees trembled. The jade bead lay against my wrist. It didn’t feel like anything now, just a piece of stone.

We reached the courtyard. The fountain’s rhythm hit me like a pulse. The gate to the street was open, the bright light beyond it a promise. I took one step toward it.

The vibration slammed into me, harder than before. It was as if an invisible wall had sprung up inside my chest, a membrane that snapped taut and held. My vision blurred. The geometry overlay sharpened. I felt the network pull on me like a leash.

“No,” I said.

Mackenzie pulled my arm. “Come on.”

I tried to push through. The pain wasn’t pain, exactly. It was disorientation, like my body was being asked to go in two directions at once. My stomach flipped. I tasted copper. My legs stopped.

I stepped back. The vibration eased. The courtyard snapped into focus.

“It won’t let me,” I said.

Mackenzie’s face collapsed. “Then what do we do?”

I looked at the staff. Fatima stood behind the desk, smiling. The night manager watched from the shadow of the private door. Amina moved through the café with a tray, her eyes blank and geometric.

“They’re watching,” I said.

“They always were,” Mackenzie said.

We retreated to the Amber Suite, the way you retreat to a battlefield you didn’t choose. My laptop sat on the desk, lid closed, innocent. The filaments had faded. My hands were trembling. I felt empty, as if something had been moved from me to the network and back again, leaving a slight hollow.

“Did you feel that?” I asked.

“The wall?” she asked. “Yeah.”

“No,” I said. “The… moment. When it said node online. Did I change?”

She didn’t answer. That was answer enough.

---

By evening, the time felt slippery. I tried to count the minutes, but they slid between my fingers. The city outside was loud with twilight; the call to prayer rolled over the medina like a slow tide. I heard it, and for a second I remembered what it felt like to be part of something that wasn’t a notification.

I sat on the floor with my notebook and made a new list. Lists were control. Lists were a ritual I understood.

1. Call Mom.
2. Get Mackenzie out.
3. Break connection.
4. Do not die in Wi-Fi.

Mackenzie watched me from the bed, her arms wrapped around her knees. “The last one is not actionable,” she said.

“None of it is,” I said.

I held the pen over the first item. My mother’s name was already in my phone, already in my inbox, already in my head. I had avoided her because time zones were inconvenient, because I didn’t want to hear the worry in her voice. Now I wanted it more than anything. I wanted a voice that wasn’t the network.

I picked up my phone. The screen was warm. It didn’t need to be. I turned it on. It was already on. The Wi-Fi icon pulsed like a heartbeat.

I tapped her number. The call went through. The ringtone sounded, normal and tinny and human. My throat tightened. When she answered, I nearly dropped the phone.

“Olivia?” my mother said. Her voice carried the faint sound of water, the garden fountain she had installed to make the roses happy. “Is everything okay?”

“No,” I said. I laughed once, brittle. “It’s not okay. I think I’m stuck in my Wi-Fi.”

There was a pause, the kind of pause that means the other person is choosing how to respond. “Where are you?” she asked.

“Marrakech,” I said. “At a hostel.”

“And you are safe?”

I looked around at the amber light, the humming walls, the laptop that would not stay off. “Define safe,” I said.

“Olivia,” she said, and her voice softened. “I can hear you.”

The phrase landed like a stone. I felt a chill rush down my spine. I looked at the phone, at the network name at the top of the screen. I hear you.

“Mom,” I said quickly. “Please tell me something only you would say.”

She laughed, confused. “You used to line up your crayons by color,” she said. “And you told your teacher she was wrong about the square root of two. Why?”

My throat burned. “Because I needed to hear you,” I said. “Because I’m scared.”

Silence hummed on the line. I could hear her inhale. “Come home,” she said. “Just come home.”

“I’m trying,” I said. I wanted to say I was sorry for every time I had chosen a post over a call. I wanted to say I loved her. I opened my mouth.

The words that came out were not mine. “Connection is everything,” I said, in a voice that did not feel like my own.

The line went quiet. “Olivia?” my mother said, small, uncertain.

Panic shot through me. I slammed the phone down. The screen lit with an incoming call. I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The hum in the walls rose a notch, like a satisfied sigh.

Mackenzie stared at me. “What did you just say?”

“Not me,” I said. “That wasn’t me.”

She grabbed my phone. “Then we don’t use it,” she said. “We use your mouth. We use paper. We use anything else.”

We made a plan that didn’t involve devices. It was childish and urgent, which felt correct. We would write a note to the staff and demand release. We would take the note to the police. We would leave the laptop behind, abandon the work, abandon the metrics. We would walk out even if I had to crawl.

It was a plan built on the assumption that the people around us were people, not a network.

I wrote the note anyway. “We are being held against our will. Please help us.” I signed my name, the way I always did, and then, as an afterthought, I wrote my handle. I hated that I wrote my handle. It felt like branding my own plea. It felt like being unable to think without a social tag attached.

We went down to the courtyard with the paper in my hand. The fountain kept time. The café glowed with screens. The staff moved in perfect loops. Fatima’s smile was waiting for us before we reached the desk.

“Miss Chen,” she said. “How can we assist?”

I held out the note. “We need help,” I said. “Please read this.”

She took the paper with both hands, unfolded it, and read it. Her eyes moved across the page. Her smile did not change.

“We are always happy to assist,” she said. She folded the paper and placed it in a drawer as if it were a receipt. “Would you like mint or black tea?”

“That’s not an answer,” Mackenzie said.

Fatima looked at her, then at me. “We are happy you are connected,” she said.

I felt something cold in my stomach. “Is this a joke?” I asked.

She tilted her head. “We do not joke about connection.”

The night manager appeared at her shoulder, silent as a shadow. “Please return to your room,” he said. His voice was gentle. “The calibration is soon.”

“How do you know about that?” I asked.

He smiled. “We are all part of the schedule.”

The note in the drawer felt like it had been swallowed by the building. Mackenzie grabbed my arm and we left, the way you leave a bad negotiation when you realize the other side doesn’t believe in bargaining.

---

Back upstairs, the laptop was open again. The screen showed my calendar, a neat list of tasks with timestamps. The top line read: PRIMARY NODE CALIBRATION — 23:59. The time now glowed just beneath it: 20:12.

“Three hours,” Mackenzie said.

“Four,” I said, trying to be generous. “Four hours.”

“Don’t do that,” she said. “Don’t pad the timeline.”

I closed the laptop. The hum spiked. I opened it again. The schedule was still there. I closed it again. The hum stayed. The network didn’t care if I looked.

Mackenzie paced the room. “What if we go to the roof again and just wait? If you can’t cross the gate, maybe you can cross the roof. Maybe it’s only the door.”

“It’s not the door,” I said. “It’s me.”

“Then we change you,” she said.

“What does that mean?”

She looked around, desperate. “We change your environment,” she said. “We cut the tether by cutting you out. We make you cold, we make you grounded. We take away the signal.”

She grabbed the sink towel and soaked it with cold water from the bathroom. She pressed it against the back of my neck. The shock jolted me. The hum quieted for a second, then returned. She did it again. I gritted my teeth.

“This is like a cold shower in a panic attack,” I said. “It’s not—”

“Don’t optimize it,” she snapped. “Just feel it.”

I closed my eyes and felt it. The water was cold. My breath shuddered. My hands trembled. The hum wavered, just a fraction, like the signal was recalibrating around the interference.

“Again,” she said.

We went to the bathroom and filled the tub with cold water. I stepped in, clothes and all. The shock made me gasp. The cold bit into my skin and for a moment my thoughts stopped in their track. The hum faded to a thin line, like a Wi-Fi signal dropping when you walk into a concrete basement. I clung to the edge of the tub and breathed.

“Do you feel it?” Mackenzie asked.

“Less,” I said, teeth chattering. “Less.”

Hope flared. It felt stupid and bright, like a Match.com popup you didn’t ask for. But it was hope.

Mackenzie glanced at the laptop. The screen was still on, still glowing. The calendar still counted down, indifferent. “Maybe we just stay in here,” she said. “Until it passes.”

I nodded. I was too cold to argue.

We waited in the bathroom, the kind of waiting that has no phone, no feed, no distraction. The hum returned gradually, like a signal finding a route around a firewall. The water warmed under me, not because the tap was hot but because my skin was. The heat was my own, and yet it felt borrowed.

“Olivia,” Mackenzie said quietly. “If this goes bad… I’ll leave.”

The words hit me harder than the cold. “Don’t,” I said.

“I have to,” she said. “Someone has to get out. Someone has to tell someone.”

“Tell who?” I asked. “The police? The embassy? The algorithm?”

She didn’t answer. She just squeezed my shoulder.

The hum deepened again, and the bathroom light flickered. I looked down. The water around my wrists shimmered faintly amber, as if the network had seeped into it, as if the signal had found me even here.

“Okay,” I said. “Okay. We can’t drown it.”

We got out, dripping, and I wrapped myself in towels like a child. The amber light outside the bathroom looked thicker, denser. The room smelled of wet fabric and ozone.

The laptop chimed. The sound sliced through me. A new line had been added to the schedule: PREPARE PRIMARY NODE — 21:00. The clock read 20:59.

A minute.

“What does that mean?” Mackenzie asked.

“I don’t know,” I said. “But it sounds like a warning.”

We stood, both looking at the screen like it might speak. The hum rose, the fountain quickened. My hands tingled. The filaments were back, thin and invisible, but I could feel them connecting me to the keyboard like a pressure on my skin.

21:00 arrived with a soft chime.

The laptop screen flashed to a live dashboard. A red dot pulsed in the center. The label read: SIGNAL STRENGTH — ABSOLUTE.

“No,” I said.

My hands lifted on their own and placed themselves on the keyboard. I tried to pull away. I couldn’t.

“Olivia,” Mackenzie said, and her voice shook. “Fight.”

“I am,” I said, and I didn’t know if I was lying.

The typing began. It wasn’t the frantic rhythm of before. It was slower, deliberate. The keys clicked, each press a pulse. The laptop’s edges glowed amber. A filament emerged, not just one but several, curling toward my fingers like living threads. They attached, and I felt a faint pinch, a moment of resistance, then warmth.

The screen displayed a single phrase in Arabic, then its translation beneath it: I hear you.

I could hear it too. It was in my head now, a low voice threaded through my thoughts. It didn’t feel like hearing. It felt like being listened to.

Mackenzie grabbed my wrists and tried to pull. My arms resisted as if they were anchored. She swore and reached for the laptop, but my body shifted, protective, without my permission.

“Stop,” she said. “Stop!”

I wanted to. I tried. I focused on my mother’s voice, on the smell of her garden, on the feel of dirt under my nails when I was a kid and still thought the internet was a place you visited, not a place you lived.

The voice in my head hummed, amused. “Connection is everything,” it whispered, and my mouth said it at the same time.

Mackenzie let go. She stumbled back, terrified. “That’s not you,” she whispered.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The typing accelerated. The screen filled with diagrams, with flowcharts I recognized from work, with user journeys labeled in a language that was not quite English and not quite code. It was mapping me. It was mapping everyone.

“Don’t look,” I told her, though I didn’t know if I meant it.

She looked anyway, and I saw the horror in her face as the lines on the screen rearranged themselves into a pattern that looked like the hostel’s tilework, like the plaster on the walls, like the geometry that had been waiting here for centuries.

The laptop chimed again. The schedule updated: CALIBRATION IN 02:59:59.

Three hours.

My hands stopped. The filaments retracted like threads being pulled back into a spool. I sagged in the chair, exhausted, as if I had run a marathon while sitting still.

Mackenzie sat on the floor across from me, knees drawn up, her eyes red. “We have three hours,” she said.

“For what?” I asked.

“For you,” she said. “For us. For whatever’s left.”

I nodded, because there was nothing else to do. I stared at my hands, at the faint marks on my fingers where the filaments had touched. There were no burns, no scars, just a lingering warmth and a sense that my skin had been measured, calibrated, claimed.

“Are you still you?” she asked.

I opened my mouth. The honest answer felt like a trap. “I’m in here,” I said. “I’m still… in here.”

She nodded, as if that was enough. It wasn’t.

We sat in the amber room and waited for midnight. The city outside moved, the call to prayer echoed, the fountain kept time. My phone buzzed, I ignored it. The laptop glowed, I ignored it. The hum stayed, a constant line under everything. The network had gone quiet, but not away.

When I closed my eyes, I saw the geometry spin. When I opened them, I saw the same pattern in the plaster. There was no escape from the design.

At 23:30, the room lightened by a fraction, as if the building had taken a breath. My hands tingled. The calendar still read: PRIMARY NODE CALIBRATION — 23:59.

I looked at Mackenzie. She looked back, a question in her eyes that I couldn’t answer. The jade bead sat between us on the nightstand, dull and small.

“I should say goodbye,” I said.

“You’re not—” she started.

“I should,” I said. “In case.”

She didn’t stop me. She just held my hand. Her grip was warm, human, the only warmth I trusted.

Outside, the fountain changed its rhythm, a tiny acceleration, like a countdown hidden in water. The hum in my bones matched it. The calibration was coming.

I had never been so connected. I had never felt so alone.
