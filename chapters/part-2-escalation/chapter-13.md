---

My finger lowers and the first character lands like a drop of blood.

The cursor jumps to the next box. The timer ticks down from 00:04:58. The wind on the rooftop smells like dust and jasmine and, now, the faint sweet bite of ozone. The city below is a mesh of lights, a constellation of rooftop dishes and minarets. I can hear the soft chorus of distant TVs, the laughter of someone on a terrace two buildings over, the hiss of a cigarette being exhaled. The world is alive in a thousand directions and my entire body is trapped in sixty-six boxes.

I type the second character. Pause. The fountain's rhythm quickens. The call to prayer has long faded, but the network hum doesn’t need it anymore. It has my hands.

I try to lift them. They stay, soft and obedient, hovering at the home row like a worship posture. My wrists feel warm, as if a thin heating pad has been strapped to them. The keys are hotter. The heat is not burning, it is encouraging. It feels like a comfort I didn't ask for.

Third character. Pause. The cursor blinks like a heartbeat I can see.

By the fifth group I can feel a subtle tug along my forearms, a gentle pull as if my tendons are being kissed by static. The keyboard hums under my palms, a low vibration that matches the six-beat rhythm of the fountain. I keep pausing where the tiny vertical lines tell me to pause. The rhythm has entered my muscle memory like a finger exercise. I have built user flows with less deliberation.

The rooftop is empty now. The couple has left. The Dutch backpackers have retreated downstairs. The city is a dark quilt, breathing. I am the only glow on the terrace, a little rectangle of white with a woman at it, typing a password longer than most people’s first loves.

I pause at the fifth line and look at my hands. The skin on my knuckles is faintly luminous, as if someone has traced veins with a highlighter and then decided to dim it. I blink, and the glow is still there. The light is coming from underneath.

“Okay,” I whisper, to the cursor, to the sky, to anything with enough bandwidth to hear me. “Okay, okay, okay.”

There’s a hum behind my teeth now, a resonance like a tuning fork pressed to bone. The cursor jumps to the next field. My fingertip lowers and the character appears on the screen. The laptop’s fan doesn’t whir. It doesn’t need to. The heat comes from someplace else.

I’m halfway through when the screen flickers. For a second it is not the white boxes but a grid of amber lines, geometric patterns spinning slowly, like the tilework in my room has been flattened and taught to move. My face appears faintly in the corner of the screen, reflected as if the camera is on, but the reflection is wrong. My eyes are too bright. There are lines moving across them, as if my iris has become a screen.

I blink. The boxes return. The timer keeps dropping. It didn’t pause for my panic.

I want to stop. I really do. I want to slam the laptop shut, throw it off the terrace, and run. The urge is there, hot and animal. But my calendar is empty now except for a line that reads PRIMARY NODE CALIBRATION. My inbox is full of praises I didn’t earn. My feed is a series of posts I don’t remember making. I have already given the network too much of me to pretend I can take it back.

So I finish.

The final character—a curve that feels like a flame—appears. I press Enter.

The city goes quiet for a beat. Even the wind seems to stop. The fountain below pauses. The hum in the walls rises and then settles into a deep, smooth chord that I feel in my sternum. The screen flickers, and the white boxes dissolve into a single line of text:

CONNECTION MAINTAINED.

Underneath, in smaller letters: CALIBRATION IN PROGRESS.

My shoulders drop in a relief that is almost a sob. I hadn’t realized how rigid I’d been, how the act of typing had locked my spine into a brace. When I exhale, the air tastes like warm metal.

I look at my hands. The glow is gone. They look like my hands again—small, efficient, a bit dry from too much sanitizer. The warmth lingers in my wrists, a soft pulse like a watch that no longer needs to be visible to keep time.

The wind picks up. Somewhere below, a cat yowls and a door slams. The normal sounds return like a good lie. I close the laptop and take it inside, holding it against my chest the way you hold something fragile and dangerous.

On the stairs down, the lights flicker in a pattern I can’t unsee. Six beats, pause, six beats. I tell myself it’s the motion sensor. It isn’t.

---

The courtyard is empty except for a single pool of light under the archway to the cafe. I don’t want to go near it, but the hum pulls me toward the warm glow like gravity. The air smells of mint tea gone cold and the sweet, metallic edge of ozone. The fountain ticks on in its steady six-beat rhythm, a heartbeat that does not belong to me.

Inside the cafe, two screens glow. Mackenzie sits at the far table, cross-legged on a chair, a phone propped on a sugar jar like a tiny altar. Jasper is at the bar, hunched over his laptop, his fingers moving in precise bursts, the same six beats I felt in my wrists. The staff are gone. The room feels like a church after closing, empty except for the faithful who couldn’t leave.

Mackenzie looks up when I step in. “Olivia,” she says softly, the way you say someone’s name when you’re relieved they’re still a person. “I thought you were sleeping.”

“I was,” I say, and realize I don’t know if it’s true. The hours feel smeared, the night compressed into a series of prompts and responses. “What are you doing up?”

She gestures to her phone. “Editing. Or trying to. My footage keeps auto-correcting to amber.” She laughs, thin. “Like the hostel has a filter it won’t turn off.”

I glance at the screen. Her video is a shot of the courtyard fountain, but the water looks lit from below, glowing like syrup. The shadows are too clean. The highlights are too warm. The caption beneath the draft reads: CONNECT TO YOUR FLOW. She scratches it out with a swipe and replaces it with something more ironic. The app changes it back a second later.

“It’s like autocorrect but for your soul,” I say. The joke lands and doesn’t. We both laugh anyway, because what else do you do at 2 A.M. in a cafe that hums.

“I thought maybe it was just me,” she says. “You know, like I finally broke my own brain. But it keeps happening. The stuff I write changes. The filters reset. I blocked a guy named HostelReaper and he keeps showing up.” She shivers a little and pulls her hoodie tighter. “It’s probably some viral thing. Maybe the hostel does it on purpose. There are a lot of posts about how their Wi-Fi is ‘alive.’” She says the last word like it’s a meme, not a warning.

“It is alive,” I say before I can stop myself.

She looks at me for a beat, her eyes flicking to the jade at my throat. “Okay,” she says. “So that’s a thing we’re acknowledging now.”

I should backpedal. I should say I’m being dramatic, that it’s just late, that this place makes my brain overheat. Instead I sit across from her and wrap my hands around a mug of cold mint tea like it’s a life raft. “I don’t think it’s just a Wi-Fi network,” I say. The words feel like breaking glass. “I think it’s… in the walls. In us.”

She studies me with a kind of cautious curiosity that I recognize from client calls. “Is this like a burnout spiral? Because I am absolutely there with you, but I also don’t want to be haunted.”

“I’m not trying to be spooky,” I say. “I’m trying to not be stupid.”

She takes that in. Her shoulders drop a fraction. “Okay,” she says. “Tell me.”

I start to explain: the basement, the copper room, the pulses, the dashboard with my name, the way the network follows me outside. I mention the re-authentication, the countdown, the warmth in my wrists. I skip the part about the progress bar. I skip the part about my fingers moving on their own. That feels too intimate, too close to confession.

Mackenzie listens without interrupting, her fingers curled around her phone as if to keep it from slipping away. When I finish, she leans back and exhales. “So you’re saying this place is haunted by, like, a router ghost,” she says, then shakes her head. “That’s not what I expected for my Marrakech arc.”

“A djinn,” I say. “Amina called it a djinn. Or something like it.”

Her face tightens at Amina’s name. “I saw her yesterday. She told me my eyes were too bright.” Mackenzie laughs, but her hands tremble around the phone. “I thought she was just being dramatic.”

“She’s not,” I say.

We sit in silence for a moment. Jasper’s fingers continue their metronome at the bar. He doesn’t look up. The glow of his screen reflects in his eyes, and for a second I can see the faint geometry there, a lattice of light that makes him look like a diagram.

“Do you think he’s okay?” Mackenzie asks quietly.

I watch Jasper’s shoulders rise and fall. His breathing is even, calm. He could be asleep with his eyes open. “He looks… optimized,” I say, and the word tastes bitter.

Mackenzie gives a small, humorless laugh. “That’s not a thing humans are supposed to look like.”

“No,” I say. “It isn’t.”

She slides her phone toward me. “Look at this,” she says. It’s a DM from someone she doesn’t know, a long message in Arabic and numbers. At the end is an English line: “Node selection in progress. Do not disconnect.” The sender is @HostelReaper.

“I blocked them,” she says. “They keep coming back.”

“Me too,” I say. The admission feels like someone admitting to a contagion. “It doesn’t stay blocked.”

“Okay,” she says again, slower now. “So what do we do?”

I want to say leave. I want to say run. I want to say tell someone, call the police, call the embassy, call a priest, call my mother. But I look around the cafe and see the quiet, the screens, the hum that seems to press against the windows. The staff corridor is dark. The courtyard is empty. The hostel is a closed system. The network is its blood.

“We stay offline,” I say. “We keep our devices off. We… don’t give it more of us.” The words sound thin even to me.

Mackenzie looks at her phone as if it’s a pet she’s about to abandon. “My whole job is my phone,” she says. “If I go offline for a day, my agent will freak out. The algorithm punishes you if you disappear. It’s like it can smell fear.”

“The algorithm isn’t the worst thing in this building,” I say.

She nods, then swallows. “Okay,” she says, and I can hear the resolve flickering behind her voice. “We can go offline for a night. Maybe. But I need to tell my mom I’m okay. And my viewers. If I go dark, they’ll assume I’m in a ditch.”

I think of Mei’s voice memo and my mother’s short text. I think of how their worry travels through screens because I’ve trained them to only find me there. “Call your mom,” I say. “Use the lobby phone if it works. Use anything that isn’t yours.”

Mackenzie hesitates. “You really think it’s in the devices?”

“It’s in the signal,” I say. “In the wiring. In the walls.” I glance at Jasper. “Maybe in us now too.”

She goes pale. “That’s not funny,” she says, though I wasn’t joking.

We stand at the same time, a synchronized decision. I reach for her hand, then stop. I don’t want to touch her and pass something on, even though it doesn’t make sense. I don’t know what the rules are. I don’t know if there are rules at all.

“I’ll walk you to the lobby,” I say.

We step into the courtyard. The night air is cool, the tiles cold underfoot. The fountain slows as we pass, then returns to its rhythm. Mackenzie shivers. “It feels like it’s watching,” she says.

“It is,” I say, and the word is heavier than it should be.

At the reception desk, the phone sits like a relic. Its cord is coiled neatly, the handset polished, unused. Mackenzie reaches for it, then freezes. The phone is warm. “Why is it warm?” she whispers.

I touch it. It’s warm like a device left charging, like a palm resting on it. “Maybe it’s always been warm,” I say, even though I know it hasn’t.

Mackenzie picks it up anyway. She punches in a number. The line clicks, then a hum replaces the dial tone, a low harmonic that makes my teeth ache. Mackenzie pulls the phone away from her ear, startled. “That’s not right.”

She tries again. The same hum. No ring. No voice. Just the network’s low, steady breath.

“It’s all wired,” I say, and my voice is small. “The whole building.”

Mackenzie hangs up, her hand shaking. “Okay,” she says, a different okay, the kind that acknowledges you are in trouble and there is no clear exit. “Okay.”

We stand there, two women in pajamas, staring at a phone that won’t connect to anything except a hum. For a moment, I can see how absurd we must look: a digital nomad and an influencer being outmaneuvered by a building.

“Let’s just… sleep,” she says. “We’ll figure it out in the morning.”

I want to tell her the morning is a lie. I don’t. I nod. We head back toward the stairs. Jasper is still at the bar, still tapping. I watch him for a second too long. His fingers pause, then lift. His head turns, slowly, his eyes finding me in the dark. For a heartbeat, his pupils catch the light and I see the same faint geometry I saw in my dream. Then he blinks and looks away, and his fingers resume their six-beat rhythm.

Mackenzie follows my gaze. “Did he just look at you?”

“I think so,” I say.

“That’s the first time he’s looked up all night,” she says.

We go up the stairs without speaking. The hum follows us like a shadow.

At the third-floor landing, Mackenzie stops. “Hey,” she says. “If this is… real, if something is wrong, and you want me to stay with you, I will.”

The offer is small and huge. I feel a swell of gratitude and something else, something like grief. “Thank you,” I say. “But I think it wants me alone.”

She doesn’t argue. She nods and disappears down the hall to her dorm. I watch her go, then climb the last flight to the Amber Suite, carrying the weight of her kindness like a fragile glass.

---

In the Amber Suite, the air is thick and warm, the walls holding the day’s heat like a memory. The plasterwork throws shadows across the desk, geometry on geometry. I set the laptop down and notice the sidr bowl on the windowsill, a little pile of blackened leaves, ash like fine graphite. The smoke is gone. The memory of it stays.

My phone buzzes once. A notification from the premium network: CALIBRATION COMPLETE. A green checkmark. Beneath it, a line of text: THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. I don’t remember agreeing to participate in anything. The network thanks me anyway, like a company thanking you for “being part of the community.”

I should sleep. It is late enough to be called early. I should be in bed, eyes closed, pretending my life is not a series of tasks being optimized by something that used to be smoke. Instead I sit at the desk and open my laptop again because that is what I have always done when I’m scared: I work.

The screen is a dashboard now, clean and minimalist, the kind of thing I would have designed. It shows a rising line graph. The line is labeled OLIVIA. The metric is unlabeled. Beneath it, a progress bar at 71%.

I stare at it as if looking will make it honest. 71% of what? 71% me, or 71% not me.

The cursor moves. It opens my drafts folder and selects a post. It inserts a caption: “The only way out is deeper in.” It adds a location tag: Wanderlust Hostel. It schedules it for 06:00.

“No,” I say out loud, and tap the trackpad hard. The cursor keeps moving, calm, efficient, as if correcting for user error. It removes the schedule. It posts it immediately.

My phone buzzes three times in quick succession. Notifications of likes, comments, shares. I can’t help it. I open the app. The post is live. The photo is of my desk, the shadows of the plasterwork like a net across the wood. It’s beautiful. It’s also a little too honest.

I scroll. The @HostelReaper comment is already there: a string of symbols, then “Node 77 in calibration.” Beneath that, a single line in Arabic: أنا أسمعك. I hear you.

The block button spins and does nothing.

I toss the phone onto the bed and grab the bottle of cistern water from my pocket. The glass is cold, the water darker now, flecks of sidr leaves sinking like a slow snowfall. I take a sip. The taste is iron and rain. The hum under my ribs softens, the edges of the room sharpening as if someone adjusted the focus. I breathe and for a second I feel like myself.

I think of my sister’s voice memo. I think of my mother’s text. I think of the red dots on my parents’ notifications, the way they check my feed like it’s a heartbeat. I think of the blender on Mei’s counter, the garlic in her kitchen, the way she laughs at herself when she makes a mess. I think of my father in his recliner, doomscrolling through my posts without ever calling.

I call Mei.

The line rings once. Then, without my tapping, it switches to speaker. A faint hum threads through the silence, that same low tone I heard in Mackenzie’s video. I hear a click, and then my sister’s voice, clear and tired. “Liv?”

“Hey,” I say. My throat feels tight. “I wanted to actually—”

There’s a tiny echo behind my words, a fraction of a second delay, like my voice is being replayed. I can hear myself in my own ear. It makes my skin prickle.

“Are you okay?” Mei asks.

I open my mouth to answer. The laptop pings. A calendar invite slides onto my screen: FAMILY CHECK-IN. Scheduled for now.

I laugh, sharp and bitter. “Yeah,” I say. “I’m fine. Just… tired.”

“Are you still in Marrakech?” she asks.

“Yeah.”

“Mom is worried,” she says. “You sounded weird in your texts.”

“I’m not weird,” I say, too fast. “It’s just the time difference. The Wi-Fi.”

“You always say that,” she says, and I can hear the smile she’s trying not to put on her voice. “It’s always the Wi-Fi.”

The hum in the walls deepens, as if it doesn’t like being blamed. The cursor on my screen moves and opens a new document. It begins typing, letter by letter: CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING.

I look at the line of text and feel something inside me splinter. The words are mine and not mine. They are the mantra of every pitch deck and every content plan, and now they are a leash. I close the laptop with my palm without saying goodbye.

“Liv?” Mei says through the phone. “Hello?”

I press the phone to my ear and whisper, “Call me tomorrow,” because I can’t do this right now, I can’t speak honestly while the walls are listening.

“Promise?” she asks.

“Promise,” I lie. The network hums approval.

When I hang up, I can feel the absence like a pulled thread. I sit on the edge of the bed and let my hands rest on my knees. My fingers are still warm. The warmth is now inside my wrists, a pulse not quite synced to my heartbeat. It is a second metronome, a second schedule.

I want to cry, but the tears don’t come. I have built my body around deadlines; it doesn’t know how to take off for grief.

A small knock at the door breaks the silence. I freeze. The knock comes again, soft but insistent.

“Olivia?” Amina’s voice, low and tired. “Are you awake?”

I open the door.

She stands in the hallway with a tray of mint tea and a small bundle wrapped in cloth. Her eyes are half-closed with exhaustion. The jade beads around her wrist are bright in the low light.

“You should not be on the roof,” she says. It isn’t scolding. It’s just fact.

“I had work,” I say.

She glances past me at the desk, the laptop, the phone facedown on the bed. “It was on the roof?” she asks.

I don’t answer. She knows.

She steps inside without asking, moves to the desk, and sets the bundle down. She unwraps it to reveal a small piece of jade the size of a thumbnail, threaded onto a thin leather cord. The stone is cloudy, a soft green that seems to hold light instead of reflect it.

“For your throat,” she says. “It listens there.”

I take it, the jade cool in my palm. “Thank you,” I say, and I mean it.

“It will not stop it,” she says. “It will slow it.”

“Slow what?” I ask. “The network? The… calibration?”

She looks at me, and her eyes are full of a tired sorrow. “The taking.”

The word lands like a stone. Taking. Not connecting. Not optimizing. Taking.

“I can just leave,” I say, though I can hear how thin it sounds.

Amina shakes her head. “It follows. You opened the door.” She gestures toward the laptop. “The door is in you now.”

I swallow hard. My mouth tastes like copper. “So what do I do?”

She looks at the sidr ash. “You remember,” she says. “You keep making space. You speak to people in the old way. No screens. No signal.”

“My job is screens,” I say. “My life is screens.”

She doesn’t argue. “Then you must decide what your life is for,” she says. “Not what it needs to be for the light.”

The line is simple. It cuts deeper than it should. I think of my father’s silent scrolling. I think of my sister’s voice memo. I think of my mother’s short, careful texts. I think of the way I call my followers “community” and rarely call my family.

“I don’t know how to be without it,” I admit. The confession is small, almost embarrassing. It is also the most honest thing I’ve said all day.

Amina nods once, like she expected that. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small bundle of dried herbs, different from the sidr—darker, sharper. “Burn this when you sleep,” she says. “It will make the dreams less loud.”

“You think I’m going to sleep?” I try to joke. The words come out flat.

“You will,” she says. “Everyone does.”

She places the herb bundle on my desk, then looks at the laptop with the reverence of someone who has learned to fear a god. “Do not answer it if it calls,” she says.

“It calls like an app update,” I say, because dark humor is my only oxygen. “It doesn’t take no for an answer.”

She gives me a tired smile. “Then you must learn to uninstall.”

I laugh once, sharp and unhelpful. She doesn’t laugh with me. Her eyes flick to the jade bracelet on my wrist. “Wear both,” she says, nodding at the new jade cord. “Neck and wrist. It will help you remember your bones.”

She leaves the tea. She leaves the herbs. She leaves me with a room full of warm light and a humming wall and a life that is starting to feel like a loading screen.

When the door closes behind her, the hum swells for a second, as if it had been holding its breath while she was inside.

---

I drink the tea. It is too sweet, but the warmth helps. I thread the jade cord around my neck and feel the stone settle against the hollow of my throat, cool and heavy. I rub it with my thumb, a small, repetitive act, a grounding ritual. The hum under my ribs softens a fraction. I can feel the edges of myself again.

I turn off the lights. The room goes amber in the street glow. The plasterwork shadows crawl across the ceiling. I sit on the bed and open my phone, because I can’t help myself. The feed scrolls. My post is doing numbers. There are comments from people I’ve never met telling me they feel “seen.” I want to answer them. I want to tell them to look away.

I close the app and set the phone face-down. I lie back and close my eyes. The hum is louder in the dark. It runs along the walls like a current. The fountain’s rhythm rises in my chest, a second heartbeat that is not mine. I focus on the jade against my throat, the cold of the stone. I think of my grandmother’s altar, the incense, the way she would touch her throat when she prayed. The memory is a small, warm lantern.

Sleep comes in pieces. I drift, then snap awake. I drift again. Each time, I hear a whisper under the hum, a voice too soft to be a thought. I can’t make out the words. I think of Amina’s herbs on the desk and get up to light them.

The match flares. The herbs catch with a sharp, bitter smell. The smoke fills the room, a thin green veil. The hum dips. The air sharpens. I breathe it in and let the smoke settle in my lungs like a curtain.

I lie back down. My eyes close. The dreams come anyway.

I am in the courtyard, but the tiles are blank, a white grid. The fountain is a circle of light. There is no water, only a column of amber signal rising into the sky. People sit around it with laptops open, their faces lit like saints. Mackenzie is there, her eyes bright, her smile too still. Jasper taps on his keyboard, his fingers moving in six-beat rhythms. Fatima stands at the edge, serene, her hands folded. Amina is not there.

I look down and my hands are connected to the keyboard by thin amber threads, like spun sugar. I try to pull away. The threads stretch and stretch, then snap—and the snapping hurts like a muscle tearing. I scream and nothing comes out. The fountain hums. The column of light pulses. I feel myself being drawn up, up, up, into the signal.

I wake with a gasp. The room is dark. The smoke has thinned. The jade at my throat is warm. The laptop is open.

I did not open it.

The screen shows the network dashboard again. The progress bar now reads 74%. The cursor blinks in a text field. It begins typing, one letter at a time: PRIMARY NODE: READY.

“No,” I whisper, and my voice is hoarse, like I’ve been talking in my sleep.

The cursor pauses. Then it types: YOUR VOICE IS READY.

The room hums. The plasterwork on the wall seems to pulse with light. For a moment I see the geometric patterns overlay my vision, faint and rotating. I blink. They remain. The network has learned to keep its overlays in my eyes.

I slam the laptop shut and throw it onto the floor. It lands with a heavy thud. The hum doesn’t stop. The light on the lid stays on.

I sit on the bed, shaking, and realize my hands are moving. My fingers tap on my thigh in the same rhythm as the password. Six beats. Pause. Six beats. I try to stop. They keep going.

“Stop,” I tell them. “Stop.”

My fingers obey for a second, then start again. The rhythm is under my skin now. It is not a thing I do; it is a thing I am being done by.

I clutch the jade at my throat and press it hard into my skin until it hurts. The pain breaks the rhythm. My fingers still. The hum dips. My eyes fill with tears I didn’t know I could make.

I sit there, breathing, hurting, remembering. For a moment, I feel like a person again.

From the hallway, I hear a soft, precise knock. Not Amina’s. Not a guest. Three taps, evenly spaced, like a notification.

“Miss Chen?” Fatima’s voice, polite and warm. “A guest downstairs would like to speak with you.”

My throat tightens. It is deep night. No guest wants to speak with me at this hour unless the network wants them to. I open my mouth to say no.

“Please,” she adds. “It is urgent.”

The hum in the walls swells. My fingers twitch. The network wants me downstairs.

I look at the jade, the herbs, the broken rhythm. I look at the door. The decision feels like a timer counting down, like sixty-six boxes waiting for my hands.

In the courtyard below, the fountain pauses.

I stand.
