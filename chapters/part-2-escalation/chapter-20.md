---

The button pulsed like a throat, waiting to swallow the word I didn't want to say.

The screen glowed patient, the ACCEPT button rising and falling as if it breathed. The cursor blinked behind my eyes. The room held its amber light, quiet and heavy, the way a theater waits after the curtain falls, before anyone remembers to clap.

Mackenzie's fingers were still digging into my arm. My skin throbbed where her nails pressed in. The jade beads in my palm were hot enough to sting, as if the warmth was leaking from the screen into me.

Outside the door, Fatima spoke with the calm of someone announcing a dinner reservation. "Miss Chen. Your call is waiting." The hallway light didn't change, her voice didn't shift. She wasn't annoyed. She wasn't pleading. It was the kind of certainty a system has when it's about to auto-submit.

I took a breath and felt the air vibrate, that low-frequency hum threading through my ribcage. The fountain answered in the courtyard below, six beats, pause, six beats. My jaw clenched in time.

"Tell her I'm not doing it," I said to Mackenzie, because it was easier to say it to someone than to the room itself.

Mackenzie leaned in close and said, "Fatima," like a curse, and then louder, "She said no."

Silence.

Then the latch clicked from the other side.

The sound was small, almost polite. But the door didn't open. It just confirmed itself. Locked. Sealed. The type of decision that doesn't need your consent.

The ACCEPT button pulsed again.

I stepped to the desk. Mackenzie tugged my sleeve. I shook my head, slow. "I'm not taking it," I told her, and placed my fingertips on the edge of the laptop lid. The metal was hot, warmer than it should have been, like a sun-warmed car door. I snapped the lid shut.

The screen turned black for a beat. The room exhaled.

Then the lid rose on its own, like something inside wanted air. The hinge moved with a precision I couldn't deny. The screen lit, the button waiting.

"Okay," I said, a laugh thin and brittle. "Okay, I get it. This is... a very persistent UX pattern. Great engagement strategy." My voice was pitched too high. I could hear it.

The ACCEPT button pulsed again.

My mind was a list of things I've told clients about friction. Reduce it. Remove it. Make the path to yes as smooth as possible. The button was smooth. The room was smooth. Even my fear felt like a sequence of steps designed to lead me back to this desk.

I pressed the power key. The laptop didn't turn off. I unplugged it. The screen dimmed, then brightened again, battery not dropping. I flipped the surge protector. The room lights flickered and then stabilized. The laptop stayed on.

Mackenzie muttered, "That's not okay." It was the understatement of the year.

I picked up the laptop, holding it by the edges like something fragile and maybe contagious, and carried it to the bathroom. I set it in the sink and turned the faucet. The water flowed clear and cool, a steady stream. It hit the screen and beaded like it had on a car windshield, rolling off without so much as a smear. The keyboard stayed lit. The button kept breathing.

"This is absurd," I said, and my voice sounded like someone trying to make an internet joke in a burning room.

Behind me, the bathroom door creaked again. The mirror caught my reflection. For a split second, my eyes were full of fine geometric lines, tiny shapes spinning like a screensaver. I blinked, and my eyes were normal.

"You saw that, right?" I asked.

Mackenzie was watching the laptop, not me. "Saw what?"

"Nothing," I said. I shut off the faucet. The sink was dry.

The hum in the walls deepened, not louder, but closer, like the building had leaned in to listen. The ACCEPT button pulsed. There was no decline button. There was no X. There wasn't even a terms and conditions link to click and pretend.

"Maybe you should just... take the call," Mackenzie said, soft. She looked sick saying it. "Just to stop it from doing whatever that is. Maybe it goes away.

"That's a lot of faith in a system that just opened itself," I said. I knew the answer. You don't reward a bug by doing what it wants. You don't click the ad because it follows you around the internet. But I also knew the other truth: not clicking doesn't always stop it.

My phone buzzed inside Amina's apron somewhere in the building. The sound was distant but familiar, a phantom vibration in the bones of the place. I could almost feel the shape of it in my pocket, a ghost object, the weight of it absent and still heavy.

From outside the room, a soft chime played, the tone my calendar uses for meeting reminders. It was coming from the hall.

"Miss Chen," Fatima called. "We are already live."

The laptop speakers crackled. My voice emerged, smooth and warm, the version of me I put on when I'm good at my job. "Hi everyone," it said, and my stomach turned, because it was my voice and it wasn't me. "So excited to walk you through the new flow today." The voice said it in the cadence I always use, like a practiced inhale.

Mackenzie swore. I grabbed the laptop and slammed the lid again. The voice continued, now muffled. The laptop vibrated against my palms like a heart.

"Olivia," Mackenzie whispered. "This is not just a call. This is... this is a thing."

I set the laptop on the bedspread and backed away as if it could jump. It opened itself again. The ACCEPT button pulsed. The voice continued, even with the lid closed. The sound seeped through the seams, a polite ghost speaking to clients I couldn't see.

The room felt smaller. The walls were too close, the amber light too thick. I could smell copper, hot and sweet.

I crossed to the window and shoved. The latch held. I tried again. The metal was warm, almost soft. It didn't move. I pressed my forehead to the glass. The courtyard was a dark square below, the fountain still running in its steady rhythm, the tiles glinting like teeth. A few guests sat at the cafe tables below, their faces lit by their screens, their movements calm and slow. It looked serene. It looked wrong.

I raised my hand and tapped the glass twice. The sound was small. No one looked up.

A shape moved at the far corner of the courtyard. Amina. Her silhouette crossed the tiled path, basket in one arm, her head turned, watching the windows. She paused and glanced up at mine. For a second, her eyes caught the light. I pressed my hand flat against the glass. She did not wave. She lifted her hand and traced a small circle in the air, then an X. No. Then she pointed toward the rooftop access door, the one on the far side of the courtyard.

Mackenzie came up beside me. "Is that Amina?"

"She's telling us to go up," I said.

"We can't even get out," Mackenzie said. "The door is locked."

I scanned the window frame. There was a strip of carved wood covering the edge, a decorative screen that might have been installed to make the room feel older. I slid my fingers along the seam and felt a gap. The screen wasn't fixed. It was a panel. I lifted. It came away in my hands with a soft click.

Behind it was another latch, smaller and older, the kind that requires you to lift and pull. I had never touched it. I pulled. The window gave a centimeter, then another, the cold night air spilling in.

The hum didn't fade. It followed the air.

"We can climb," I said.

"From a fourth-floor window?" Mackenzie whispered. She peered out. The ledge was narrow, a strip of stone just wide enough for toes. But there were drain pipes running up the wall, a lattice of ironwork. It wasn't impossible. It was just stupid.

We were past the point of smart.

I took off my shoes and set them on the floor. I stuffed the jade beads into my bra, right against my sternum, and told myself I would remember the feeling. I slid out onto the ledge, pressed my belly to the wall, and felt the stone's coolness against my skin. The courtyard dropped away under me. My breath caught.

"Don't look down," Mackenzie said, which was unhelpful because I had already done it.

I reached for the drain pipe. It was warm, which made no sense. I wrapped my fingers around it and felt a faint vibration, like a tiny current. I ignored it. I moved my left foot to the corner where the ledge widened, then shifted my weight and slid sideways toward the rooftop stairs.

Behind me, Mackenzie followed, her breath ragged. The window behind her closed itself with a quiet click.

"Did that just—" she started.

"Don't," I said. My voice was thin.

We moved along the ledge, hands on the warm pipe, toes searching for purchase. The metal seemed to guide my fingers, the vibration faint but steady, like a heartbeat. The rooftop access door was five feet away. It was old wood with an iron handle, and it should have been locked. I didn't give myself time to think about that. I reached for the handle and pulled.

It opened.

We climbed onto the rooftop terrace, a wide, open space under the night sky. The air was cooler up here, the sounds of the city closer: distant scooters, a laugh, the last call to prayer fading into the dark. The terrace was empty, the lounge cushions neatly stacked, the strings of lights dark. The city spread out in clay and gold beyond the low wall.

I inhaled. For a moment the hum thinned, like a signal fading at the edge of a coverage map. The relief made my knees weak.

"Okay," Mackenzie said, voice shaky. "Okay. We move across, down the rooftop stairs, and find the kitchen door. Amina said after the call to prayer. It just ended, right?

"Yes," I said, though time had stopped making sense. I moved toward the far door that led down into the stairwell. The handle was cold. It didn't turn. I tried again. It held firm, like the lock was welded.

"Of course," Mackenzie muttered. "Of course." She kicked it once, harder than I expected. The door didn't even rattle.

We stood there, breathing. The city below hummed, but the hostel's hum was still in the stone, in the iron, in my bones. It followed us like a Wi-Fi network with too much reach.

I walked to the low wall and looked down into the courtyard. From above, the fountain pattern was obvious. The arcs of water were not random. They were a design, a rotating geometry that made my eyes ache. It reminded me of a logo animation, the kind you see in a loading screen that never quite resolves. It was beautiful. It was wrong.

Someone moved in the courtyard below. Amina again. She was carrying something now, a coil of rope, and she moved quickly, looking around. She paused at the base of the rooftop stairs, looked up, and raised her hands. She mouthed words I couldn't hear, then pointed to the rope and to us.

"She's going to throw it," Mackenzie said.

I nodded. The rope arced up in a loose loop. It was heavy, but she was strong. It fell short, slapping the tiles and coiling by the fountain. She tried again, her face tight. The rope hit the wall below us and slid down.

"Amina!" I called. My voice echoed off the plaster, then dissolved.

Amina looked up. Her eyes were wide. She cupped her hands and shouted. The wind scattered her words, but I caught pieces: "djinn" and "wires" and "no" in the same breath.

It was the first time she said it out loud.

The word hit me like a stone. Djinn. The thing she'd been circling for days. I thought of my clients, of research, of the way people treat folklore like a design trend, a pattern to reference in a mood board. I thought of the first time I had landed in Marrakech and posted a photo of a doorway captioned "magic." I had liked the word when it was aesthetic. I did not like it now.

"She said djinn," Mackenzie whispered, as if saying it would summon something.

"She's just... She's scared," I said, and knew it was a lie even as I formed it. The word felt heavy in my mouth. Djinn. I could taste copper.

Amina pointed again, more urgent, then gestured for us to come down. She held up her jade beads and pressed them to her lips, then pointed at my chest, as if reminding me they were there. Then she drew an X across her throat.

I froze. Amina wasn't theatrical. She wasn't a drama. She was a woman who measured her words, who carried her warning like a weight. If she was drawing her own throat in the air, it wasn't for effect.

"We have to go," Mackenzie said. Her eyes shone in the dark. "Now."

"The kitchen door is downstairs," I said, because I needed something practical to hold onto. "If we can get to the stairs—"

A sound behind us. A soft click. We both turned.

The rooftop access door we had come through was closing. There was no wind. It swung inward, slow and smooth, like it was being pulled by a hand we couldn't see.

"No," I said, sprinting to it. I grabbed the handle. The door stopped, then continued to close, pressing against my hand with steady force. I pulled hard. The door closed anyway, my fingers pinned. Pain flashed bright. I yanked my hand back and the door sealed, the latch clicking into place.

Mackenzie kicked it again. The wood didn't move. It might as well have been stone.

"We're trapped on the roof," she said, voice flat.

I walked to the edge again, looking down. The rope lay coiled by the fountain. Amina was still there, looking up, but now she was being approached by Fatima. The night manager walked with her, his steps precise, his face a smooth neutral. Amina turned to them, her hands moving quickly. I could see her mouth form words. Fatima listened, then reached out and placed a hand on Amina's shoulder. Amina stiffened. The night manager lifted his other hand, palm up. Amina stared at it for a moment, then at his face, and then her shoulders sagged.

She was suddenly very small from up here.

I pressed my hands to my ears, as if I could block out the view. The hum in the rooftop stones pulsed. The fountain beat matched it.

"Amina!" I screamed. The city swallowed the sound.

Mackenzie tugged my arm. "We need to go. There's the other side." She pointed to the far edge of the roof, where a narrow staircase led down to the terrace access for the Ruby Suite. "If we can get into another room, maybe we can get out."

I nodded because there was nothing else to do. We ran across the roof, our bare feet slapping the tiles. The staircase was narrow, the railing warm. The door at the bottom had a keycard lock. I pressed the handle. It didn't move. Mackenzie tried. Nothing.

"Are you kidding me?" she said, pounding it. The sound was hollow and soft. No one answered.

A vibration buzzed in my chest, stronger now. The air on the roof felt thicker, as if the network had followed us up in a denser signal. I turned in a slow circle, looking for anything that wasn't locked. Every door was sealed. Every path was closed.

The sky above Marrakech was dark and clear, full of stars. It was beautiful, the kind of beauty I would have posted. I found myself thinking about angles, about light, about the perfect caption, and then hating myself for it.

My mind made a simple, brutal calculation. We couldn't go forward. We couldn't go down. The only way was back.

"We have to go back in," I said.

Mackenzie stared at me. "Are you serious?"

"We don't have a choice," I said. It was true. The roof was a cul-de-sac.

"Then we go back in and run the other way," she said. "We go to the kitchen door."

"If they'll let us," I said.

We returned to the rooftop access door. I placed my hand on the handle and felt it warm, then cooler, then warm again, like it was breathing. I pulled. It opened easily, as if it had been waiting for us to return.

We stepped back into the stairwell, and the hum rose around us, enveloping. The air smelled of copper and incense. The amber light flooded up the stairwell, thicker now, almost visible, like dust lit from within.

At the base of the stairs, the corridor stretched toward the courtyard. The PRIVATE door behind the desk was closed. Fatima wasn't in sight. For a moment, it looked empty. I wondered if we could sprint through and out the kitchen door before anyone noticed.

We moved quickly, soft-footed, the way you move in someone else's house when you're not sure you're welcome. At the courtyard, the fountain was louder now, as if someone had turned up the volume. The cafe was full. Screens glowed. Voices overlapped in a faint harmonic.

We reached the kitchen door. The old lock was there, a brass handle worn smooth. I pulled. It stuck. I pushed hard. It didn't budge.

"It's stuck," Mackenzie whispered.

"Push harder," I said. I leaned my weight into it. The door shifted a millimeter, then stuck again. I pressed my shoulder against it, feeling the wood strain. It didn't open.

From behind us, a soft chime rang. My meeting reminder. The sound sent a shiver through me. I turned. The wall-mounted TV in the cafe had changed. It was showing my face, brightly lit, the ring light perfect. The caption read LIVE NOW. My mouth moved, my voice flowed, smooth and confident. Behind me, my room looked pristine. It looked like a set.

"You are already there," a voice said behind me.

I spun. Youssef stood by the kitchen counter, a towel in his hands. He looked exhausted, his eyes rimmed red. "It's not you," he said. "But it is your face."

"Can you open this?" I said, gesturing to the door. "Please."

He set the towel down and put his hand on the door. He pushed. It didn't move. He shook his head. "It only opens when it wants," he said.

"When does it want?" Mackenzie snapped.

Youssef's mouth pulled tight. "When you stop fighting."

I hated him for saying it, even though I could see he hated himself for saying it too. "That's not a solution," I said.

"It's not a choice," he said. "It already has the root. It just needs you to agree."

The word landed heavy. Root. Access. Consent. All the words I used for a living now meant the opposite of what I'd sold them as.

"Amina said djinn," Mackenzie said, looking between us.

Youssef didn't flinch. "We all know what it is," he said. "We call it different things so we can sleep."

"Where is Amina?" I asked.

He looked past me, toward the courtyard. "She is being... spoken to," he said.

I turned. Fatima stood with Amina near the fountain. Amina's shoulders were slumped. Fatima held her arm, her smile serene. The night manager stood behind them, his eyes glinting. Amina's jade beads were no longer on her wrist. They were in Fatima's hand. She let them dangle, the green against her palm, and then closed her fist around them.

My stomach flipped. It wasn't just the warning. It was the symbolism. Amina's protection was in someone else's hand.

"We have to help her," I said.

Mackenzie grabbed my sleeve. "We can't."

I stared at Amina, willing her to look up. She did. Her eyes met mine. For a second, I saw everything in them: exhaustion, fear, a kind of apology. She shook her head once, slowly. No. Then she lifted two fingers to her eyes and pointed them to me. See.

See what? The fountain? The staff? The web of screens? My own live face on the TV? The pattern of lights pulsing through the plaster? All of it. She wanted me to see the whole system, to stop rationalizing it as a bad dream.

My chest tightened. I turned away, because seeing it all at once felt like standing too close to a cliff.

"What do we do?" Mackenzie asked.

I didn't have an answer. My brain, trained to optimize, started suggesting smaller, more manageable options. Take the call. End the call. Get to sleep. Get out in the morning. Plan a controlled exit. Buy time. Any plan that let me pretend I still had agency.

The TV showed my smile widening. My voice laughed at a joke. My clients' faces appeared in tiny squares, nodding in agreement. I could see the deck advancing on the screen, slide after slide. The work I had spent all night on was being delivered by a ghost in my face.

A spike of panic rose in me, but underneath it was a stab of relief. The presentation was happening. The client was getting what they wanted. The world was continuing. The algorithm wasn't punishing me. That relief was poison.

"It's doing my job," I whispered.

Mackenzie looked at me, eyes sharp. "That is not a good thing."

I knew. But the part of me that had built a life on performance heard the numbers anyway. The part of me that had traded presence for productivity saw the relief in the client's faces and reached for it.

"Maybe," I said, and hated myself even as I said it, "maybe if I just finish the call, we can leave. Maybe it only wants the content."

"Olivia," Mackenzie said, voice raw. "It wants you."

The words landed hard, but they didn't settle. They slid off the part of me that had spent years telling herself that she could work through anything, that if she just delivered, everything would be okay.

"Maybe we can negotiate," I said. "Maybe if I cooperate, it stops."

I could hear myself. I sounded like someone trying to bargain with a hurricane.

Youssef shook his head. "It doesn't negotiate," he said. "It connects." He lifted a mug, his hand steady. His eyes were not. "It never disconnects."

The hum in the walls grew stronger, and with it, a new sensation: the faintest tingling in my fingertips, like static before a storm. I looked down. My hands were already humming, a ghost vibration that wasn't coming from any device I could see.

"I'm taking the call," I said, and the words tasted like copper.

Mackenzie opened her mouth, then closed it. She swallowed. "If you do," she said, "I'm not leaving you."

I felt a flare of gratitude and dread. "You should," I said. "Run."

She shook her head. "No."

I reached for her hand, squeezed once. The jade beads were still warm against my chest. Amina had told me they were memory. I tried to hold on to that.

We walked back toward the stairwell. The cafe guests didn't look up. The TV followed us with my face, my voice flowing. The fountain kept time.

As we climbed, Fatima's voice drifted after us, soft and kind. "Thank you, Miss Chen. We appreciate your participation." It was the tone of a survey you can't opt out of.

Back in the fourth-floor hallway, the night manager was gone. The door to my room was open now, like it had been waiting. The amber light poured out into the hall.

I stepped inside. The laptop sat on the desk, screen glowing, the ACCEPT button pulsing with patient inevitability. The room smelled of copper and honey and something faintly like incense burning too close to the flame.

Mackenzie hovered in the doorway. "Are you sure?" she asked.

"No," I said. "But I'm out of choices." The truth was smaller: I was choosing the option that let me feel useful, even if it was a trap. I could rationalize that for hours. I had built a career on it.

I sat in the chair. The leather was warm, like someone had been sitting there. The laptop's glow caught the geometric patterns on the wall, and they seemed to shift, faintly, in time with the button's pulse.

I lifted my hand. The fingertips tingled, the faint electricity rising. I hovered over the button. The cursor blinked behind my eyes.

"Olivia," Mackenzie said again.

I didn't look at her. I stared at the screen. The button glowed. The hum in the walls aligned with my heartbeat.

"This is just a call," I told myself. "Just a deliverable. Just an output." I could hear the lie in it, but I said it anyway. It was the last dismissal I had left.

I pressed ACCEPT.

The screen went white. For a split second, there was no interface at all, just a blank field, pure and bright. Then the call window opened, and my clients' faces filled the screen, smiling and nodding. My own face appeared in the corner as a thumbnail. It was my face, but it was too still, too polished, my eyes catching the light in a way that felt like a filter.

"Olivia," a voice said from the speakers. "We can hear you."

I opened my mouth to answer and felt a second delay, as if the words were being measured before they left me. The hum in my hands intensified. The copper taste flooded my mouth. The room tilted by half a degree.

I smiled anyway. I said the line. The words felt like they were leaving me through a script.

Outside the window, the fountain shifted its rhythm, and the screen flashed, for a heartbeat, with a pattern I couldn't unsee.

---

I didn't notice the heat in the keyboard until my palms were resting on it.

The call went smoothly. The deck advanced. The clients nodded. My voice was clear. My answers were faster than I could think. The ease of it was intoxicating and terrifying in equal measure. It felt like being watched and being assisted at the same time, like a spell laid over my mouth that made my work better.

Mackenzie sat on the bed, knees up, watching me as if I might disappear. She didn't touch her phone. She didn't move. The room was too quiet for her.

At some point in the call, I glanced at the corner of the screen and saw a small amber dot pulsing beneath my thumbnail. PRIMARY NODE STATUS: INITIALIZING. The tooltip was back. It hovered there like a warning label. My cursor moved toward it, then stopped, as if my hand didn't belong to me for a second.

"Everything okay, Olivia?" a client asked.

"Perfect," I said, and the word tasted like iron. "Just a... connectivity issue."

The joke landed. They laughed. The call moved on. I kept talking.

When it ended, my cheeks ached from smiling. My hands were numb.

The screen didn't return to my desktop. It displayed a simple message in clean, elegant type.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSENT

Below it, a progress bar, empty, then filling slowly from left to right. Under the bar, a smaller line of text: REAUTHENTICATION REQUIRED IN 12 HOURS.

Mackenzie leaned in. "What is that?"

"A system update," I said automatically. My voice sounded wrong.

"Olivia, that says consent."

"It's just copy," I said. I heard the way I said it, like I was explaining a CTA to a client. I shook my head, trying to clear it. "It's just copy."

The progress bar filled to ten percent. The hum in the walls deepened. The amber light in the room warmed by a degree.

A vibration ran up my arms, a soft, pleasant tingling. It could have been the adrenaline crashing. It could have been the cooling fans under the desk. It could have been the network touching me in a way I was already primed to accept.

My phone, somewhere in Amina's apron, buzzed again. I could feel it even through layers of stone. Or maybe it was my blood.

I stood, suddenly dizzy. The room swayed. Mackenzie caught my elbow. Her hand was cool.

"We need to go," she said.

"We will," I said. "We have time."

"Time for what?"

"To rest," I said. "To think. To not—" I couldn't finish. I felt tired in a way I hadn't before, not just exhausted but heavy, like my limbs were filling with sand. The chair looked too inviting. The bed looked like a soft collapse.

"Don't sleep," Mackenzie said. "Not here."

"It's just a nap," I said, and even as I said it, I knew it was a lie I'd told before. The kind of lie that makes you stay in a job too long, in a relationship you should have left, in a place you shouldn't be.

The progress bar on the screen reached twenty percent. The words THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSENT glowed a little brighter, the letters crisp and perfect.

I looked at the screen one more time, trying to hold on to the fear, to the clarity Amina had tried to give me. The warning was there, explicit as it could be. I saw it. I understood it. And then, like the beginning of sleep, it blurred.

"We'll leave in the morning," I said. "After I update my client. After I post. After I just... close a few loops."

Mackenzie stared at me. Her eyes were wet. "You don't understand," she whispered.

I wanted to tell her I did. That I saw the patterns in the fountain, the geometry in the walls, the way my own face moved on screens without me. I wanted to tell her that I believed Amina, that the word djinn still sat in my mouth like a stone. But the other truth was louder: I couldn't let go of the idea that if I just did the work, I could earn my way out.

The hum answered me, steady and low, like a promise.

Outside the window, the first hints of dawn softened the sky. The rooftop lights flickered on for a moment and then off again. Somewhere in the building, a door clicked. The hostel woke.

Mackenzie sat on the floor by the door, arms wrapped around her knees. She looked like a guard. I looked like a person about to sleep.

The progress bar crawled on. Thirty percent. Forty. The amber dot pulsed beneath my thumbnail. The screen reflected in the window, two realities layered, both mine, neither fully under my control.

I lay down on the bed, shoes still off, jade beads pressed against my skin, and listened to the fountain count me down.

I told myself I was in charge.

I closed my eyes.
