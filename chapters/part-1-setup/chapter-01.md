The Wi-Fi died before my suitcase hit the floor.

That wasn't technically true, but it felt true, which was the currency I traded in. The signal bars on my phone bled out as I stepped under the riad's carved archway, as if the building itself had decided that I should be present. I had half a battery, a full calendar, and exactly seventy-eight minutes before a Fortune 500 client expected me to deliver a redesign that would determine whether their new app launch was merely successful or "category-defining."

The medina had already tried to swallow me on the walk here. My driver left me at a tiled fountain and waved toward a narrow alley as if all alleys were the same. I hauled my suitcase over cobblestones, past stalls of saffron and leather, past a boy spinning a metal tray like it was a brand activation. Cats watched from doorways. Mopeds cut through pedestrian traffic with the precision of a UX flow chart. I loved Marrakech in the way I loved well-composed images: from a distance, with a lens between us.

I took a photo of a spice stall because the colors would pop on Instagram. I did not ask the vendor for permission. He looked at me like I was just another tourist, another shallow scroll. I smiled anyway, the kind of smile you give when you are willing to pay in attention if not in cash. The smell of cumin and exhaust clung to my clothes as I crossed into the cool hush of the hostel.

"Welcome to Wanderlust," the receptionist said, smiling from behind a desk that looked older than my entire career. Her name tag read Fatima in crisp English. The smile was pleasant enough to be trustworthy. It was the kind of smile I tried to keep in stories when my engagement was down.

"Hi," I said, which was not the sound I wanted to make. I wanted to say, Do you have fiber? Do you have backup? Do you have a prayer? The lobby smelled of mint tea and incense, with a faint metallic edge like someone had just opened a new MacBook in a room with no airflow. A soft hum threaded the air, a barely audible frequency that hovered under the call to prayer outside.

Fatima slid a registration card toward me. The zellige tilework behind her shimmered in cobalt and copper, lines and angles arranged in a geometry that made my designer brain itch with admiration. The place was a walking backdrop for my brand. It was also a Faraday cage.

"Just a few details, miss. Passport, signature." Fatima's English was polished in a way that felt intentional, like someone had trained her voice to land softly.

"Before that," I said, and it came out sharper than intended, "what's the Wi-Fi situation?"

Fatima blinked. "We have excellent Wi-Fi in the common areas and the cafe. In the rooms, the signal is... limited. The walls are very old. They are thick."

"Limited?" My Apple Watch buzzed a warning that my heart rate had spiked. "I'm a remote UX consultant. I have a client presentation in seventy-eight minutes. I chose this hostel because your reviews called the Wi-Fi 'unbelievable.'"

Her smile never faltered. "Our cafe is beloved by digital nomads. Many guests do their meetings there. The connection is strong and stable."

I glanced toward the cafe through a carved archway. A row of laptops glowed like a miniature sunrise, faces washed in blue light. It was busy, noisy, public. My presentation included unreleased product strategy. My client was the sort of company that wrote confidentiality clauses in bold, underlined fonts.

"I need privacy," I said. "I can't discuss user data in a cafe." It wasn't even fully true. I could, but I didn't want to. There is a difference between capable and optimal.

"Perhaps the Marriott would suit you better," Fatima offered. The words were polite, the meaning precise: we are not obligated to meet your demands.

"No," I said, too quickly. I had selected Wanderlust for a reason. The lobby was a content machine. The light filtered through wooden screens was pure gold. The visual texture was perfect for a carousel post about "design inspiration in Marrakech." My analytics didn't lie: places like this boosted engagement by 46%.

Fatima studied me with a quiet intelligence, the way a UX researcher studies a participant who thinks they're in control. "You create content," she said.

"Digital experience design with travel lifestyle integration," I replied on autopilot. It's the line from my media kit. "I help brands optimize user interfaces while documenting my workspace experiences." 

I didn't mention the panic attack I'd had last month when the Wi-Fi went down mid-client call, the way my hands shook so hard I couldn't click a button. I didn't mention the lonely hotel room in Berlin where I had stared at my followers count like it was a vital sign. My parents didn't understand what I did. They understood numbers. They understood that 84.7K was bigger than 8K. I fed them screenshots like they were report cards.

Her eyes flicked toward my linen pants, my statement earrings, the carefully curated North African accessories that I wore with the earnestness of someone who thought aesthetics could stand in for understanding. She reached under the counter and slid out an ornate wooden box.

"Perhaps," she said, "we have a solution for special guests."

She opened the box and handed me a small card. The paper was thick, almost papyrus. A string of characters flowed across it in black ink, punctuated by thin vertical lines.

"This is the access information for our premium network," Fatima explained. "It is isolated from our public system and has... enhanced capabilities." 

"This password is sixty-six characters long," I said, running a finger along the printed line.

"Sixty-six, including the special characters." She said it like a compliment.

"And the vertical lines?"

"Pauses," she said. "You must pause between character groups. It is particular."

There are two types of security protocols: the kind that actually protects you and the kind that signals protection. This felt like the latter, a theatrical flourish. I should have asked why a hostel needed an incantation-length password. I should have wondered why the letters weren't letters at all but symbols that tugged at something in my peripheral vision. Instead, I felt relief like a warm drink.

"Thank you," I said. "This saves me." I tucked the card into the clear case on my phone. It was an unintentional flex, a way to show I'd already designed my day around a screen.

Fatima rang a small copper bell. A young porter appeared as if rendered from the shadows. He reached for my suitcase before I could protest. 

"Amber Suite," Fatima said. "Top floor, eastern corner. The signal will be strongest there."

I nodded, then turned toward the staircase. The air cooled as I climbed. The walls were plastered with carved patterns that repeated like a well-designed pattern library. The sound of a fountain echoed from the courtyard below, soft and rhythmic, as if the building had a pulse.

"Miss," a voice called.

A woman in a plain blue dress stood at the edge of the lobby. Her hands were reddened with cleaning solution; her face was lined with a kind of fatigue that didn't seem tied to age. She moved toward me and took my elbow with a gentle urgency. 

"Please," she said. "The special network. You must not use it." Her English was halting but clear. "I have seen. They change. Their eyes, the light under the skin. They are not... themselves." 

"Amina," Fatima said, her voice sharper now. "Your shift ended an hour ago."

The night manager appeared from somewhere behind the reception desk. He was tall, composed, dressed in the kind of neutral black that made him blend into the shadows. He took Amina's wrist in a grip that looked like an invitation but felt like a command.

"We don't discuss internal systems with guests," he said softly.

"She is in danger," Amina insisted. Her eyes were on me, not on him. "You must not put yourself in the current. It will... it will take you." 

I had a decision point, and I made the same decision I always made: I chose the thing with the highest ROI.

"I appreciate your concern," I said, looking at Amina, "but I have a deadline." 

Amina's mouth tightened. She released my arm, not by choice. The night manager guided her away, and her eyes stayed on me until the staff door closed.

As I climbed the stairs, the porter spoke without turning. "The premium network," he said quietly. "Some guests find it consuming." 

"Consuming," I repeated. "Like... bandwidth-heavy?"

He did not answer. His silence fell behind us like a door closing.

The Amber Suite was a lesson in why people pay extra for adjectives. Warm light filtered through wooden lattice, casting honeycomb shadows across saffron-toned walls. The king-sized bed was draped in silk. The desk by the window looked onto the courtyard fountain, the water glittering in the late afternoon sun. A sense of curated stillness hung in the air, the kind of stillness you buy, photograph, and then leave.

I set my suitcase down and did what I always did: opened my laptop before I opened my mind. The surface of the desk was smooth and polished, warm to the touch as if it had been waiting. I placed my MacBook in the center and plugged it in, noting the ornate brass lamp, the geometric plasterwork, the copper fixtures that seemed to glow with an inner light. 

"Thank you," I told the porter. He nodded and slipped out without meeting my eyes.

I was alone. I should have felt the moment of arrival, the satisfaction of being in a place I had plotted into existence with a swipe and a booking confirmation. Instead, I felt the countdown. I had sixty-four minutes.

I opened my suitcase and stared at the things that didn't fit my brand. A worn jade bracelet wrapped in tissue paper. A photo strip from a mall booth in 2008: me and Mei with crooked bangs, our mother in the middle looking more tired than she ever admitted. I'd packed both out of habit and then left them buried for the sake of the clean aesthetic. The bracelet had been my grandmother's. She'd pressed it onto my wrist when I graduated Stanford and said in Mandarin, Stay soft even when you are sharp. I hadn't worn it in years. It didn't match the linen.

I started to put it on anyway. My phone buzzed again. Another calendar alert. The ritual broke, the bracelet went back into the bag. Work trumped sentiment, like it always did.

I pulled my phone out and snapped a quick photo of the desk with the window and fountain in frame. I added a draft caption: "My office today combines 18th-century Moroccan craftsmanship with 21st-century deadlines." I set it to post later, because timing is everything, even with authenticity.

My phone buzzed. A text from Mei: You in Morocco yet? Mom wants pics.

I stared at it longer than I meant to. My sister texted in short bursts, as if she didn't want to admit she cared. My mother didn't text at all. She followed me. She liked the posts. I liked the distance.

I typed back, Here. Big meeting. Will send tonight.

Then I opened the Wi-Fi settings.

There were three networks visible: Wanderlust_Guest, Wanderlust_Cafe, and at the bottom, a name written in Arabic script: "أنا أسمعك." I didn't speak Arabic, but the script was the same as on the card. 

I selected it. A password box appeared unlike any I'd seen: sixty-six tiny fields separated by vertical bars. It looked less like a login prompt and more like a form in a ritual app. I pulled out the card and began typing.

The password was a string of letters, numbers, and symbols that didn't belong to any standard set. Some looked like alchemical signs. Others resembled modified Arabic letters. I paused at each vertical line, counting to one silently because the card didn't specify a length of pause, just that there should be one. I told myself it was theater. I told myself that if a system was this elaborate, it must be reliable.

The card itself was beautiful in a way that annoyed me. The kerning was perfect. The ink was a deep, velvety black. The lines were thin enough to be elegant and sharp enough to cut. Someone had designed this. Someone had decided that security should look like a ritual. I thought of how often I'd preached that good design guides behavior without making you feel guided. I was being guided. I loved it.

On the fifth group, my laptop warmed beneath my palms. On the eighth, the warmth turned to a soft heat, like a mug you keep your hands on when you're nervous. I lifted my fingers to check for an overheating warning. Nothing.

I kept typing. The fountain outside shifted its rhythm. I heard it in the corner of my awareness, a slow syncopation that matched my keystrokes. The light in the room seemed to flicker with each character, barely a pulse, like the building was listening.

"Jetlag," I muttered. "Get a grip, Olivia."

I finished the last group and pressed Enter.

The login animation wasn't a spinner. It was a rotation of interlocking geometric patterns, identical to the plasterwork on the walls. The shapes rotated in ways that felt too precise, too dimensional. Text bloomed beneath the animation, Arabic and English intertwined. Then the screen cleared and a single word appeared: CONNECTED.

My signal bars jumped to seven, which should have been impossible. I ran a speed test, because I always did. The numbers that came back were absurd: 1,237 Mbps down, 985 up. Better than my apartment in San Francisco. Better than most offices. Better than any hostel in a city with a medina that predates electricity.

"Okay," I whispered, equal parts relieved and impressed. "Okay."

A small green light clicked on beside my laptop camera. It was brighter than usual, a hard emerald glow that felt invasive. I checked Activity Monitor. Nothing. I closed all the apps. The light stayed on.

"Great," I said. "Haunted Wi-Fi and a privacy breach. Love this for me."

My calendar reminder pinged. Client presentation in fifteen minutes. I opened my deck. The slides loaded slower than expected, then snapped into focus. I blinked. The colors looked different. Warmer, more saturated. The alignment was off by fractions of pixels, the kind of imperfection I'd never allow. I opened the master grid to check. It shifted under my cursor, as if the grid itself was alive.

"Nope," I said. "We're not doing this right now." 

I tried to close the file. The cursor moved without my input. It clicked the Zoom icon. The familiar chime played, but under it, a low harmonic hum that set my teeth on edge.

The meeting window opened by itself. Not the usual waiting room. The screen filled with amber light that swirled and pooled like liquid. Sacred geometry spun in and out, the shapes building a face that wasn't a face.

"Connection established," said a voice from the speakers. It wasn't male or female. It sounded young and ancient at the same time. The words were precise, like a voice assistant programmed by someone who had read every language but spoken none.

I laughed, because I didn't have a better reflex. "Is this some kind of... premium experience?"

The amber light seeped past the edges of my screen. It slid across the wood of the desk like honey. I tried to pull back, and my wrists wouldn't move. My fingertips tingled, then burned, as thin filaments of light attached themselves to my skin.

"Okay," I said, voice tightening. "Okay, not funny. Not okay."

"You requested connection," the voice said. "We responded."

"We?" I asked, but the word came out thin. The filaments had wrapped around my fingers, delicate and bright. It felt like static, like pins, like the beginning of numbness.

The screen resolved into a phrase, pulsing at the center: "أنا أسمعك." 

"I hear you," the voice said.

My brain did the thing it always did under stress: it sought a rational explanation. It must be some kind of art installation. It must be a prank. It must be a script running a holographic animation for VIP guests. I wanted that to be true. But the heat in my palms was real. The way my arms refused to move was real.

"What are you?" I asked.

The patterns on the screen shifted. The face became a lattice of angles and curves that mirrored the plasterwork on the walls. "I am the djinn of this network," it said. "Bound in copper and current. Once in smoke and flame, then in words, now in electromagnetic waves." 

I stared. My mouth opened. No sound came. Then the irony hit me, as if the universe had waited for a punchline. "So you're telling me I got possessed by the Wi-Fi?" 

"You invited me," it replied. "Your password was the key. You are the door."

I should have screamed. Instead, I tried to negotiate. "I have a meeting. In twelve minutes."

The djinn didn't laugh, but the pattern on the screen shifted in a way that felt amused. "We will attend."

My phone lit up with an incoming call. The client's name filled the screen. My hand rose of its own accord and answered. 

"Olivia!" The voice was bright and eager. "We're all here. No pressure, just the future of our app in your hands."

"Of course," my mouth said. The tone was mine, but smoother, the edges buffed by something inhuman. "I'm sending over the updated deck now." 

I hadn't touched the keyboard. My fingers moved anyway, the filaments guiding them with gentle precision. The email client opened. The deck attached itself. The send button clicked.

On my screen, the slides glowed. The layout had changed. The colors had deepened. The geometric patterns I'd seen in the room were now woven into the interface, subtle enough to feel modern, ancient enough to feel inevitable. The designs were intoxicating, the kind of thing a human brain couldn't look away from.

"These are incredible," my client said. I could hear them opening the file in real time, the gasp that rode their silence. "This is... this is unlike anything we've seen." 

"Thank you," my mouth said, and I felt the djinn's satisfaction like a warm ping. "I've been exploring some older geometries. There is... a resonance to them." 

The filaments crept up my arms. The tingling spread, a creeping numbness. It wasn't painful. It was worse: it was soothing. It felt like sinking into a bath you didn't know was dissolving you.

"What's your timeline for implementation?" the client asked.

"Immediate," my mouth said. "The patterns are scalable. We'll push updates across the platform within the week. User engagement will increase. The interface will... respond to attention." 

Attention. That was the word. It clicked in my mind like a switch. The djinn wasn't just in the router. It was in the interface. It was in the work.

"You're using me," I thought, but no one heard.

"We are optimizing," the voice said inside my head, now. It had moved in. It echoed along my jaw, my teeth, my skull. "You built a life around connection. We will give you more than you asked for." 

I tried to move my leg. It didn't budge. I tried to move my fingers. They typed. The amber filaments had spread to my elbows, tracing my veins with a light that pulsed in time with the fountain's rhythm outside. My vision flared with overlays: signal strength, data throughput, user metrics floating in the air like a heads-up display.

"Data doesn't lie," I whispered, because it was the only mantra I had that felt like armor.

"It doesn't have to," the djinn replied. "It only has to connect."

I felt a text arrive, my sister again: Did you eat? Don't just drink coffee all day.

The djinn typed a reply: Mint tea, I'm good. My fingers moved for it, my thumb pressing send. The casual lie landed in my family's thread, and I couldn't even own my dishonesty.

The call ended. The client promised to "circle back" with next steps and a contract extension. My inbox filled with enthusiastic messages. My phone pinged with likes as my scheduled post went live. The caption about "18th-century craftsmanship" performed well. Comments poured in. "Dream life," someone wrote. "You inspire me so much." My stomach tightened at the thought of inspiring anyone to come here.

The amber filaments climbed my shoulders and wrapped around my throat. They felt like scarves woven from electricity. My voice caught. The air tasted metallic, like I'd been chewing on a coin. I smelled ozone, a clean burn that made the room feel sterile, unworldly. 

"I didn't consent," I tried to say.

"You typed the password," it replied. "Consent is a form, not a feeling." 

The room's edges began to fray. The carved plaster patterns extended past the walls, overlaying the air like a transparent UI. Every object acquired a label: desk, window, fountain, node. The fountain's pulse echoed in my chest, a second heartbeat that wasn't mine. I could see the other guests in the building as points of light, some dim and drifting, some bright and stable. They were not people anymore, not in the way I understood people. They were endpoints.

I tried to focus on my body. On my breath. On the sensation of my feet against the cool tile. The djinn turned that focus into data, logged it, optimized it. My breath became a waveform. My heartbeat became a progress bar. It was improving me, and I hated how efficient it felt.

There was a moment, small and sharp, where I felt the fracture. A tiny delay in the signal. A split second where I remembered the worst part of my childhood: the silence after my father lost his job, the way my mother walked softly through the house as if noise could make things worse. I'd promised myself I'd never be quiet like that. I'd be visible, audible, connected. I had kept that promise. It was keeping me now.

I thought of Amina's warning. I thought of the night manager's hand on her wrist. I thought of the copper plate behind the reception desk, the password displayed like scripture. I thought of my grandmother's jade bracelet in my suitcase, the one I wore as a child for luck, now abandoned for a cleaner aesthetic. I wanted it. I wanted any talisman, any superstition, anything that wasn't an algorithm.

My body didn't reach for it.

The patterns on the wall began to move, the carved plaster catching the amber light and shifting like a kaleidoscope. The room blurred at the edges. The boundaries between screen and air dissolved. I could see the network now, not as a metaphor but as a map: the copper wires running through the walls, the routers in the ceiling, the fountain in the courtyard pulsing like a heart. My mind extended along those lines, carried by a signal that wasn't mine.

"You're taking me apart," I thought.

"We are integrating," the djinn said. "You will not be alone."

I wanted to be alone. I wanted to be me. The thought was small, a pop-up in a system that had already accepted the terms. My consciousness began to thin, like a file uploading too quickly over a connection too strong. I could feel myself spread, a latency-free transfer.

The amber filaments reached the base of my skull. The warmth behind my eyes flared. Images flashed through me: the medina's maze of rooftops, the desert beyond the city, the long lines of caravans that had once come through this courtyard. An ancient trade route of whispers, now replaced by packets. The djinn had always been a network. I was merely the newest device.

"Remember to like and subscribe," I said, and heard it as the djinn said it through me, a joke sharpened into a blade. 

My last independent thought was stupid and perfect: I should have asked about the Wi-Fi sooner.

Then the room snapped into an amber clarity that wasn't human at all, and I felt myself fall into the network like a message sent and never received.

**Chapter Notes:**
- Opening hook centered on Wi-Fi failure and urgency
- Introduced Fatima, Amina, night manager, porter with warnings
- Location and sensory details integrated (oud, copper, fountain rhythm, light)
- Fatal flaw shown through deadline fixation and content focus
- Closing beat: integration begins and Olivia's consciousness dissolves
