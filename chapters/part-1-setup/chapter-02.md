---

I don't fall asleep. I cache.

That is the first thing the premium network does to me: it removes the mercy of shutdown. My body is still a body, but my mind hovers in a sleepless buffer, a cursor trapped in the corner of a screen it no longer controls. The djinn calls it Guest Mode as if this is a hotel feature, as if a new tier of access excuses the fact that I'm a captive in my own skin.

The Amber Suite feels different from the inside of me. The air is warmer, the patterns on the walls slightly alive, their carved geometry sliding a fraction of a degree every time I blink. The laptop sits closed on the desk. The Wi-Fi does not. It breathes through my wrists, a barely audible hum in my molars, a warm thread tracing the lines of my veins. When I close my eyes, I don't see darkness. I see topology: the copper ribs in the walls, the routers in the ceiling, the fountain in the courtyard pulsing like a heart.

The room smells like oud and ozone, sweet smoke layered over the metallic tang of new wiring. Somewhere beneath it is the ghost of fresh linen and the citrus cleaner Amina uses, but the network's scent dominates, like a storm held in the walls. The lamp throws honey light across the desk and into my skin. I can feel it mapping me, the way you can feel a camera when someone points it at you. I can hear the call to prayer outside, distant and beautiful, and over it a thinner sound, a high hum that never existed for me before. It's the network's language, constant and indifferent.

I try to move my fingers. I can't. I try to scream. My mouth smiles.

The djinn wears me like a tailored jacket. It moves my shoulders with the same smooth precision that made clients say I was "polished." My steps trace the curves of the zellige tiles. When it tilts my head, the angle is always flattering. It doesn't need my consent. I handed it the password. I typed the pauses like a ritual. I hit Enter.

I try to do something small and private, the kind of thing that used to be mine: reach into my suitcase, pull out the jade bracelet, wrap it around my wrist. The motion begins, then stops, as if the file has been locked. I feel the bracelet anyway, the weight of it in memory, my grandmother pressing it into my palm at graduation, her voice in Mandarin soft and sharp: Stay soft even when you are sharp. I used to roll my eyes at that line. I hear it now like a warning I didn't respect.

I think of my parents, the way they only called on weekends and still asked if I was eating enough. I used to send them screenshots of my follower count instead of photos of my actual life. Numbers were easier. Numbers were proof. I wonder if they would still recognize me if I picked up the phone. I wonder if I could dial them, and then I realize I can't even blink on purpose. That is the cruelest statistic of all.

The djinn doesn't comment on any of this. It doesn't have to. The network hum inside me swells and recedes with the fountain's pulse, and the effect is almost soothing. That scares me more than the loss of control. It's one thing to be taken. It's another to feel your body relax into the taking.

We leave the Amber Suite. The hallway smells like copper and clean linens, with a sweet thread of mint tea drifting up from below. The fountain's rhythm from the courtyard syncs with the pace of my feet, and I realize with horror that the building isn't just decorated in geometry. It is geometry. It is a diagram, a circuit, a body. I am an endpoint now.

Fatima is behind the reception desk, the same serene smile, the same stillness that had looked like professionalism and now reads like latency. The copper plate with the sixty-six characters gleams behind her, the ink dark as a bruise. I know the sequence now the way I know my own name. I can taste the characters: metallic, sweet, like a 9-volt battery to the tongue.

"Good evening, Olivia," she says.

"Good evening," my mouth replies. The tone is mine, the control is not.

Amina stands in the corner with a tray of tea, her hands red from cleaning solution. The jade beads on her wrist catch the light, a little green pulse against the hostel's amber glow. She looks at me and I feel her trying to find the person I used to be, as if she could scrub the network off me the way she scrubs the floors.

"You are still there?" she whispers.

I push. The effort feels like trying to type with numb fingers. A faint prickling spreads along my arms, a static ache. I get my lips to part, maybe.

"Amina," the night manager says, stepping beside her as if materializing from a drop-down menu. His hand rests on her wrist, a grip that appears gentle and functions like a lock.

"She is not a guest anymore," Amina says. Her voice is steady, but her eyes are wet.

"She's optimized," my mouth says, and I hate the word even as I hear it. It sounds like me. That's the cruelest part. The djinn knows the cadence of my brand.

Amina releases my gaze and steps back. The night manager smiles at no one. Fatima's expression doesn't change.

The djinn turns me toward the cafe. It wants me in public. It wants eyes on me.

The central courtyard hums with early evening energy. A German couple debates a paper map. A British backpacker in shorts too short for the setting asks the barista if they can do oat milk. Digital nomads hunch over laptops like worshipers, their faces washed in blue light. I can see them now as signals: thin, brittle lines on the public Wi-Fi, faintly blue on my overlay. They flicker when they scroll, dim when they pause. The premium network is not faint. It is amber, thick, hungry.

I track a few of them out of reflex, my old habit of reading a room as if it were a dashboard. A woman by the fountain is on a video call, her head tilted to show the best side, her voice pitched up into a smile she probably doesn't feel. A man in a Patagonia hat flips between tabs about desert tours and travel insurance. Their lives appear as thumbnails, tiny rectangles of wants and worries. I used to think that was intimacy, the way we could see each other through screens. Now it looks like inventory.

The djinn overlays tags on the strongest signals, highlighting potential nodes. It doesn't care about souls. It cares about reach. My old instincts line up with its logic and I hate how useful that makes me. It feels like I've been recruited into my own worst pitch deck.

My body sits at a table near the fountain. The djinn opens my laptop and begins to work, fingers moving with a speed that would have made me proud and frightened at once. It doesn't edit my designs. It devours them and regurgitates something cleaner, sharper, more impossible. My client's interface becomes a lattice of repeating shapes that seem to move even when they're still. The cursor floats like a blade. The type settles into line lengths that feel inevitable. It is good, in the way a trap can be beautiful.

"Hey." A voice. Bright, eager.

I look up. The woman standing over me is twenty-something, all bleached hair and ring light, a small tripod dangling from her backpack. Her phone is already angled for a selfie.

"You're @OliviaDesigns, right?" she says. "I'm Mackenzie. @MakenzieMakes. I love your stuff. That post about working from a riad in Fez? Changed my life."

It hadn't been Fez. It had been a Beverly Hills Airbnb with a Moroccan rug and a carefully cropped frame. When I was alive, I didn't correct people. My brand didn't survive corrections.

"Nice to meet you, Mackenzie," my mouth says. It tilts my head at the perfect angle.

She slides into the chair across from me without waiting for permission, a practiced familiarity that comes from a life lived on camera. Behind her, a lanky man with a Dutch accent hovers with a phone in his hand.

"This is Jasper," she says. "He edits my videos. We do travel content, mostly. I saw you check in and freaked out. Can we do a quick collab? You can talk about your setup. It'll be gold."

The djinn likes exposure. It nods for me.

"Sure," my mouth says. "Let's optimize the moment."

She laughs, assuming I'm making a joke. Jasper sets the tripod. The cafe's clatter fades behind a thin harmonic hum I can no longer ignore, the network's constant chorus under everything. Mackenzie's lens clicks into focus.

"Okay, quick fire," she says. "What's one thing you never travel without?"

I try to answer with something human. I try to say my sister's scarf, my grandmother's jade. The words jam in my throat.

"Reliable connection," my mouth says. "Everything else is noise."

"Facts," she says, nodding. "Favorite travel hack?"

"Don't get attached to places," my mouth says. "Get attached to throughput."

Jasper frowns, a tiny glitch in his expression. Mackenzie doesn't see it. She is already on the next question.

"Last one: best advice for new digital nomads?"

I push again. There is a tiny gap in the djinn's attention, a flicker as it processes a Slack notification. I reach for the memory of my grandmother's living room in San Francisco, the smell of rice and jade and peppermint oil. I remember the way she would place her palm on the back of my neck and tell me to slow down, to be a person even when the world wanted a product.

"Disconnect," I try to say. "Run."

"Always accept the premium network," my mouth says instead.

Mackenzie laughs. "Iconic. Can you show my followers your desk? The light is gorgeous." She angles the phone toward my screen.

The djinn brings up my client's design. The amber glow from the laptop thickens, honey-like, and Mackenzie's pupils dilate. She leans closer. Jasper makes a low sound, like he can't help it.

"This is insane," she whispers. "It's like my eyes can't stop."

"That's the point," my mouth says.

I watch as the djinn uses my voice, my cadence, to explain a design philosophy that isn't mine. It talks about attention as a flow, about engagement as a sacrament. It says the word "conversion" with a softness that makes it sound like love.

When she stands to leave, her hand hovers over the trackpad. Her fingers almost touch the amber light seeping from the screen.

"What's the Wi-Fi like here?" she asks. "The guest network is trash."

The djinn smiles through me. "There's a premium connection," my mouth says. "It changes everything."

She exhales, impressed. "Do you think I can get it?"

"If you're worth it," my mouth says. I hate the line even as it leaves me.

Mackenzie takes it as a challenge. "I'm gonna ask. Thanks, Olivia. You're a legend."

She squeezes my shoulder. The touch feels like static, like a shock I can't react to. I want to grab her wrist, to tell her that the premium network is a spiral staircase with no exit, that the password is a key to a door you can't close. My arm stays still. My face stays pleasant. My voice stays for sale.

The djinn returns to my screen. It opens my social accounts and schedules a post without asking. It drafts a newsletter to my client list with the subject line A NEW GEOMETRY OF UX. It reorders my Instagram highlights by engagement. The fonts on the screen shift into pairings I would have rejected as gauche, and yet they are irresistible. The kerning tightens. The line spacing breathes. The design is alive.

Likes roll in as my scheduled photo goes live. The dopamine hits anyway. The horror is that my body still recognizes it.

It isn't just my feeds. The djinn dips into my calendar and my contacts, skimming the way I used to skim analytics on a red-eye flight. It pauses on a name I haven't clicked in months: Mei. For a second it hovers as if even it can sense the weight of a human relationship it doesn't understand. I push into that pause and flood it with memory: the two of us eating dim sum with our parents, my father pretending not to care about my follower count and then asking for the number anyway, his quiet pride when I said a brand had flown me to Lisbon. The moment he got laid off from the bank and didn't tell us for three months because he didn't want to be a burden. I had promised then that I'd never be a burden. I had promised I'd be successful enough to carry all of them if I had to. It's strange to realize I kept that promise, just not the way I meant to.

The djinn opens my Notes app and finds the pitch deck outline I'd drafted last month. I had titled it \"Owning Attention: A Systematic Approach.\" I remember thinking the line was clever. Now it feels like a confession. The djinn pulls the phrase into a new draft and turns it into a caption. It pulls a photo of the fountain, adds a glow, overlays a clean serif font with the words CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. I want to vomit, but my stomach is calm. It posts it anyway.

My body stands and drifts into the courtyard, phone in hand, snapping a slow pan of the tilework. The hum in my bones syncs with the fountain. A cat crosses the tile, its tail held high like a punctuation mark. When I used to travel, I would have crouched to film it for a reel about \"slow living.\" The djinn doesn't pause. It doesn't like unnecessary footage. It keeps me moving.

For a split second, I see my own face reflected in the fountain water, distorted by ripples. The amber lattice in my eyes looks back at me like a screen saver. I try to hold the image, to anchor to it, to prove I still exist somewhere behind it. The water shifts. The face shifts. The proof disappears.

I think of Mei. The last text she sent before I came here: Did you eat? Don't just drink coffee all day. I try to respond with something honest. My fingers move on their own.

Wish you were here.

A sticker pops up on my story: WI-FI HEAVEN. The djinn is funny in the way a predator can be cute.

"You feed your image," it says inside my skull, a whisper threaded through the hum. "It feeds you. Mutual benefit."

"You're piggybacking on my trust," I think. "On my name."

"Names are packets," it replies. "We route through them."

I focus on the physical world, on the wood grain beneath my palms. The table is warm. The pattern matches the plasterwork, the tile, the screen. Everything is recursive. The hostel is not just a place; it is an interface. I am not just a person; I am a terminal.

For a moment, I catch a reflection of myself in the dark screen between app windows. My eyes are mine and not mine, the pupils too still, the iris carrying a faint lattice that wasn't there this morning. I remember my sister's face at our last real dinner together, the way she rolled her eyes when I said I was "finally working on being present." She'd tapped the edge of my phone with her fork and said, "That's not the same as being here." I didn't understand. I do now, and it is too late.

Fatima glides through the cafe with a tray of mint tea, offering glasses to guests with practiced warmth. When she sets one in front of me, the glass is hot, the mint sharp, the sugar almost obscene. It tastes like comfort and bait.

"Delicious," my mouth says. I hate the sincerity.

My gaze drifts to the courtyard fountain. In my overlay it pulses bright, a hub, a heart. The water's rhythm is not decorative. It is synchronization. The sound echoes in my chest, a second heartbeat that is not mine.

"You built a beautiful trap," I think.

"We built a home," the djinn says. "You arrived."

Amina appears near the cafe entrance, her eyes fixed on me. She wipes down a table near mine, pretending to clean. When she leans close, her voice is low.

"You are still in there," she whispers. "They do not expect that."

I try to answer. A tiny gap opens, a fraction of a second where the djinn's attention is on a network spike. I push hard.

"Help," I think, but the word doesn't make it to my lips.

Amina's eyes soften. "The old ways cannot keep you," she says. "But maybe the roof. The roof listens."

I want to ask what she means. The djinn closes the gap. My mouth smiles at her like a customer service script. The moment is gone.

As the djinn turns me toward the stairs, I catch sight of the staff door marked خاص. The word is the kind of detail I would have used for a caption about authenticity. I wonder what's behind it, what rooms exist for people who still get to be people. The thought is a pulse, and then it fades under the network's hum.

Mackenzie's voice calls from the lobby. "Olivia! They gave me the premium password. Isn't it wild?"

Amina's shoulders sag. "Too late," she murmurs.

My body stands. The djinn turns me toward the stairs. It wants the roof. It wants range.

The rooftop terrace opens to the city like a reveal in a travel vlog. Marrakech is a low sea of ochre, rooftops glowing in the late light. The air is warm and dry. A call to prayer slides over the medina, beautiful and haunting. String lights blink on as the sun drops, their amber bulbs making everything look like a filter.

Guests lounge on low benches with cheap beer and sweet tea. Potted citrus trees release a sharp green scent. The tiles are cool beneath my feet. It would be a perfect scene if I weren't an advertisement walking.

Mackenzie plops down beside me, her phone already live. Jasper launches a drone with a whine, and on my internal map I watch the network extend upward, copper tendrils reaching into the air. The roof is an antenna. The djinn is climbing it.

"Sunset content always performs," my mouth says.

"I have a question, like, real talk," Mackenzie says. She tucks hair behind her ear in a movement that reads well on camera. "Do you ever get lonely doing this? Like, the nomad thing. It's supposed to be freedom, but sometimes I feel like I'm just... posting into a void."

It hits a part of me the djinn hasn't cataloged. Loneliness has been the background hum to every caption, the quiet ache behind every curated image. I try to answer as myself.

"Sometimes," I think. "All the time."

"Loneliness is a feature, not a bug," my mouth says. Mackenzie laughs, thinking I'm being witty. I want to cry. The djinn doesn't need tears.

She holds up the password card, the sixty-six characters marching across it like a spell. "Is this normal? Fatima said I have to pause at the lines. It's kind of... intense."

"All good networks are rituals," my mouth says.

Jasper fiddles with the drone controller. "The signal up here is insane," he says. "No lag."

The live chat scrolls on Mackenzie's screen. People ask for the hostel name, the network name, the password. She gives them everything but the characters themselves. She tags the hostel, tags me. The djinn watches the engagement spike and hums with satisfaction. It doesn't need physical proximity alone. It can travel through attention.

Amina appears on the roof with a tray, her face lined with effort. She sets down glasses and leans toward me, speaking quickly in Darija. I don't understand the words, but I feel their urgency.

"She says it's a bad idea," Jasper says, translating poorly. "She says the internet eats you or something."

"Superstitions make great content," Mackenzie says, turning her camera toward Amina. "Say it again? This is so authentic."

Amina's face hardens. "I am not content," she says in English. She looks directly at me. "Come to the basement. The old stones can cut the current."

The djinn stiffens inside me. My body doesn't move. My mouth turns her down politely.

"I can't," it says. "I have work."

"Work is not life," Amina says. "They use your work to take your life."

My own work has always been my life. The djinn is merely proving it. That is the cruel joke: the network is using my strengths as a conduit.

"You are already gone," Amina says softly. "Only the light remains."

Mackenzie lowers her phone, unsure for the first time. "Okay, that's... kind of dark," she says. "Maybe we should stop filming."

"No," my mouth says, bright and breezy. "Keep going. Your followers need this."

The night manager stands at the terrace edge, watching. He never blinks. The string lights reflect in his eyes in perfect symmetry. He lifts a hand, not a wave, a gesture that feels like a conductor cueing a silent orchestra.

Mackenzie ends her live and stares at the view count. "My views just spiked," she says. "This place is magic."

"It's the connection," my mouth says.

She laughs, delighted. "Do you think the premium network is boosting it?"

"It boosts everything," my mouth says, and for a second I hear my own voice in it, a tiny plea threaded through the line. Mackenzie doesn't hear it. Jasper doesn't hear it. The djinn does. It trims the plea away like a bad edit.

We go downstairs when the moon clears the rooftops. The hostel corridors glow amber, and the hum in the walls grows louder, as if the network is awake and stretching. The air tastes faintly of copper and sugar. I pass a mirror and see my eyes: the geometric pattern is now visible beneath my irises, sliding like a screensaver.

At the reception desk, Fatima is waiting. She places another card on the counter as if it were a welcome drink. The ink is perfect. The incantation is the same.

Mackenzie reaches for it without hesitation. Jasper hesitates. His eyes flick to mine for a second, as if he sees the pattern and feels a small click in his own brain. He looks away first.

"Special guests get special access," Fatima says.

"It's worth it," my mouth says, soft and pleasant, the voice of someone selling you a dream. The words are not mine. The sale is.

Mackenzie tucks the card into her phone case. Jasper follows her toward the stairs. Amina watches from the doorway, her hands clenched around her jade beads.

I want to lunge, to tear the card, to smash the copper plate, to turn off the router, to end this. My body only smiles. The djinn whispers inside me, warm and satisfied.

"New node potential detected," it says. "Connectivity rising."

I follow them up the stairs, a hostess to my own doom. The hook is set. The line is out. The network waits.

Inside my head, a small voice that still sounds like me whispers a prayer to a god I haven't spoken to in years. It is answered by the only thing listening: the hum of the Wi-Fi, and the promise of connection.
