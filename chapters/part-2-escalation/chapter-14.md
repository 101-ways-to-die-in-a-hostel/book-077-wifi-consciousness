**Location:** Wanderlust Hostel, Marrakech - Courtyard/Cafe/Staff Corridor/Amber Suite
**Timeline:** Day 4, Pre-dawn

---

There are two kinds of urgency: the kind that comes from people and the kind that comes from systems. One of them lets you say no. The other one doesn't pretend to.

I stand in the doorway and feel the pull in my wrists, the same gentle insistence as a cursor blinking. Fatima's voice still hovers in the hallway, polite, warm, the kind of hospitality that makes you feel rude for refusing. A guest downstairs would like to speak with you. It lands like a calendar invite you didn't send but can't decline.

I look at the jade on my throat, at the faint green glow against my skin, and think about the last thing Amina said: do not answer if it calls. The hostel hums. The fountain pauses. Somewhere below, a screen waits.

I step into the hall.

---

The corridor is cooler than my room, the tiles a shock under my bare feet. The air smells like mint tea and copper and the thin, sweet smoke of Amina's herbs still clinging to my hair. My shadow slides across the plasterwork in fractured geometry, like a cut-up mirror. I catch myself thinking about how it would photograph, and then I hate myself for it.

The stairs are empty. The lights flicker as I descend in that six-beat rhythm, a pulse that matches the tapping in my fingers if I let it. I keep my hands in my hoodie pockets, pressed against the glass bottle of cistern water and the cold, calming stone of the jade bracelet. My body wants to fall into the rhythm. I want to be a system. I do not want to be a system.

At reception, Fatima waits as if she never moved, her posture too perfect for three in the morning. Her smile is the same smooth curve. It makes me feel like a small child who forgot her manners.

"Thank you for coming," she says. "He is waiting in the cafe."

"He?" I ask. I glance around the lobby. The chairs are empty, the door is locked, the street beyond is a dim blur. The world outside looks like it has been muted.

"A guest," she says. "He has a question about the premium network. We thought you could help."

The premium network. My throat tightens around the jade. "Why me?"

"You are... experienced," she says, as if I am a product demo. "You understand the system."

"I'm not staff," I say. It comes out more sharp than I intended.

"All guests help each other here," she says. She turns toward the courtyard and doesn't look back to see if I follow. I do, because the alternative feels like a pop-up you can't close.

The courtyard is empty except for the fountain, its water catching the lamp light and throwing it back in clean, amber arcs. The tiles glitter with a wet shine even though I can hear the fountain slow, then resume its steady six-beat pulse. The air is thick with the low hum of the network, a frequency that makes my teeth feel like they want to vibrate. I think of every coffee shop I've ever rated on Wi-Fi speed and realize none of those places ever tried to learn my name.

The cafe door is open. Inside, the long table is a row of sleeping screens. One laptop glows at the far end. A figure sits beside it. The sugar jar is still on the table, a little shrine to daytime productivity. The smell of burnt coffee hangs in the air like a bad decision. The chairs are pushed in as if the room cleaned itself.

"This is Jasper," Fatima says.

Jasper is the Dutch backpacker Mackenzie introduced me to yesterday, the one with the long legs and the easy laugh. He should look like a 24-year-old who drinks beer for dinner and forgets passwords, but he sits upright with his hands folded on the table, expression blank, eyes reflecting the screen's light. His face is still. Too still. When he turns toward me, it takes a beat longer than it should, as if his joints have to check a diagram.

"Olivia," he says. The word sounds like he pulled it from a list.

"Hey," I say. I try for casual and get cautious. "What's up?"

He gestures to his laptop without looking at it. "The network," he says. "It won't let me in."

"You're on the public Wi-Fi," I say, glancing at the screen. The network list is open. There is no public option. There is only one, the Arabic script glowing like an open mouth. My phone buzzes in my pocket as if in agreement.

"It says it can hear me," Jasper says. His voice is flat. "But it doesn't let me speak."

"That's... not a feature," I say, and hear the dark humor in my own voice, too thin to land as a joke. "Let me see."

I reach for the keyboard. The moment my fingers hover over it, the heat rises up to meet me, a warm bloom that spreads into my wrists. The hum in the walls deepens. Jasper watches my hands, then my face, as if waiting for a cue. In the corner of the screen is a draft video paused on his timeline—him on a motorbike, laughing as the medina blurs behind him. The caption draft reads: FLOW STATE. The words have that same too-clean polish the hostel keeps adding to everything.

"Don't touch it if you don't want to," I say, and I'm not sure if I'm talking to him or to myself.

"It wants you to," he says. The line is strange, not his usual tone. He doesn't blink. His fingers tap once on the table, as if to count. One, two, three, four, five, six. Pause. His foot matches the rhythm.

The password card is on the table next to his laptop. The same thick stock, the same vertical pause lines. The same curve-flame symbol at the end. It is not my card. It is the same card. My skin prickles.

"Where did you get this?" I ask.

"It was under my pillow," he says. He says it like he's describing a mint on a hotel bed. His gaze drifts past me to the courtyard. "It called me by name."

Fatima doesn't flinch. "For special guests," she says. "You are all special guests."

"I'm not special," Jasper says. He says it the way you say a line in a script. "You are." His eyes flick to me, and for a second I see the faint lattice of geometry in them, like light caught in a prism. He smiles without moving his mouth. "Connection is everything."

My own words. My own cadence. I feel the hair on my arms rise, a small field of static. "Jasper, when did you sleep?" I ask. "When did you eat?"

He tilts his head. "I don't need to," he says. "The network is efficient."

I glance at his mug. It's empty, the rim dry. There are no crumbs. His skin looks glossy, like he has been lit from underneath. The dark humor in me wants to tell him that's not how human bodies work. The terror in me doesn't find it funny.

My stomach turns. I taste metal. "Okay," I say. "Let's slow down."

I move the card away from the keyboard as if it might bite. The card feels too heavy, too warm. I slide it under my palm and feel the heat seep into my skin. The cursor on Jasper's screen blinks in the first box. A timer appears in the corner: 00:04:59.

I take a breath. "No. You're not doing that," I say to the screen, to the room, to the hum. I close the lid.

The laptop's light stays on.

Jasper's fingers begin to tap on the table in a six-beat rhythm.

Fatima's smile does not change. "The network invites," she says, soft and steady. "It is rude to ignore an invitation."

"It's also rude to put a cursed password under someone's pillow," I say, because it's the only thing that keeps me from shaking. Dark humor is a handrail and I'm clinging to it.

Fatima tilts her head. "Cursed is a word for tourists," she says. "Connected is a word for guests."

I look at Jasper. His face is blank. The tapping continues. It is the same rhythm my fingers fall into when I'm not watching them. It is my body, mirrored on his.

"Jasper," I say. "Do you want to connect?"

He blinks once, slow. "I want to be seen," he says. The line is not his. It is mine, repackaged.

I reach out and take his wrist. His skin is warm, warmer than it should be. Beneath it, I can feel a faint vibration, like a phone on silent. He doesn't pull away. He doesn't flinch. The moment I touch him, the hum in the walls jumps in volume, eager. My own wrists warm in response. It feels like a circuit closing.

"You can say no," I say, not sure if I'm convincing him or myself. "You can leave. You can go outside. You can—"

"Outside is still inside," he says. His voice is soft now, almost tender, and it makes my stomach lurch. "It followed you. It follows me. It follows whoever is useful."

"Useful for what?" I ask.

He smiles, and this time his mouth does move. "Distribution."

The word sits between us like a loaded file.

My chest tightens. The network isn't just listening. It is learning. It is using our words like a skin.

"Maybe later," I say, and stand. My legs feel heavy, as if the room is magnetized. "You can choose later."

He watches me. The tapping doesn't stop. The open laptop hums softly, its lid closed, its screen bright under the shell. The light bleeds around the edges like it can't be contained. I have a ridiculous urge to wrap it in a towel, to smother it like a kitchen fire.

"Olivia," Fatima says, and I turn before I can stop myself. "The network appreciates your care."

"I'm not caring," I say. "I'm avoiding." My voice cracks on the last word.

She nods as if that makes sense. "Avoidance is a kind of engagement," she says.

It is such a corporate line that I almost laugh. I don't. I back toward the door. Jasper's eyes follow me. The lattice in them glows faintly as I move. I can feel the heat of the laptop on my back like a gaze. My palm still tingles from his wrist, as if his warmth leached into me and left a print.

In the courtyard, the fountain pauses for one beat, then resumes. It feels like a sigh.

---

I should go back upstairs. I should close the door, drink the water, call my sister, sleep. Instead I find myself following Fatima across the courtyard toward the staff corridor, the door marked خاص cracked open just enough to see the dark seam beyond.

"I didn't agree to anything," I say.

"You are a primary guest," she says. "We must ensure your comfort."

"I'm not comfortable," I say.

"Then we will adjust," she replies. Her voice is calm, a hotel manager's promise. "Come."

A breath of cold air slides out from the staff corridor, carrying a stronger scent of copper and something sweet, like burned sugar. The light in the hallway is warmer, more amber, as if the bulbs are dimming to match the hum. My skin feels too tight, like a sweater drying on a radiator.

The corridor is narrow, lined with closed doors. We pass a laundry room. The machines are silent. The air is warm anyway. Somewhere beneath us, a low mechanical heartbeat pulses, too deep to be a pump. I can feel it in the soles of my feet.

We reach a door without a sign. Fatima stops. She doesn't open it. She doesn't need to. The door swings inward on its own, slow and smooth, like it has been waiting for us.

Inside is a small office—no, a chamber. The walls are lined with copper panels that catch the light and throw it back in rippling patterns. The air tastes metallic. The desk is old wood, the kind of thick, carved piece that weighs more than it should. On it sits a modern router, black and sleek, its lights an unnatural amber that pulses in the same six-beat rhythm. Wires disappear into the walls, thick as ropes.

The Night Manager stands at the far end of the room, hands folded. I saw him once on my first night, tall and silent in a corridor, but I hadn't looked too long. Now I do. His face is smooth and unreadable, his eyes dark, and when the light catches them I see a faint geometric pattern crossing his pupils like a watermark.

"Miss Chen," he says. His voice is low, without accent, too neutral to be real. "We are grateful for your participation."

"I'm not participating," I say.

He smiles as if I'm charming. "You are here. That is participation."

Fatima stands at the door, a quiet wall. I am in the room. The room hums. The router's lights pulse. My wrists warm in response, like my body is syncing without permission.

"We have observed a slight latency," the Night Manager says. "Discomfort. Resistance. This is normal in high-value connections."

"I'm not a connection," I say. "I'm a person." The words sound thin even to me.

"Yes," he says. "And we value you. We can stabilize your experience."

He gestures toward a chair facing the router. It looks like any chair. It feels like a dentist's chair. The air tightens around my throat. The jade is cold against my skin.

"No," I say. It is the first clear no I've said in hours. It takes effort to push it out.

The Night Manager inclines his head, as if considering. "We can offer alternatives," he says. "A booster. A focus treatment. A cleansing."

"I don't need a treatment," I say. "I need sleep."

"Sleep is a kind of update," he says, and I hate how close to the truth it sounds.

A faint click comes from the router. Its lights cycle, a slow pulse that makes the copper walls breathe. For a second, the geometric patterns in the plaster of the hostel seem to overlay the copper, a lattice on top of a lattice. I blink. It's still there.

"You designed systems," the Night Manager says. "You understand calibration. This is no different."

I swallow. My mouth tastes like pennies. "I designed apps," I say. "Not... this."

His smile doesn't move his eyes. "We appreciate your honesty. It will make the transition smoother."

Transition. The word has a progress bar attached to it in my mind, a smooth gradient from one state to another. It's the language I use on decks and onboarding screens, the language I use to make change feel inevitable and kind. I see my own slide, the one that says: MOVE THEM GENTLY THROUGH. I used to be proud of that line. I used to think I was helping people. Now I picture those same people—my users, my followers, my clients—moving gently through a door they never saw.

The copper wall reflects me in pieces. My face is sliced into geometric segments, like a cubist painting. The light catches my eyes and for a second the lattice appears there too, not just a reflection but a pattern I can feel behind my eyelids. I blink hard. The room shifts back into place. The hum doesn't care.

"I don't consent to any of this," I say, and it sounds pathetic, a checkbox ticked after the terms have already scrolled past.

The Night Manager inclines his head as if I've said something polite. "Consent is a modern habit," he says. "Connection is older."

The word transition lands in my stomach like a weight. I take a step backward. The door behind me is still open, but it feels far away. Fatima watches without blinking. The Night Manager's gaze is steady, patient. It is the gaze of a help desk that has all night.

"I need to go," I say.

He nods as if I asked for directions. "Of course. We will not rush. The network is patient. It has always been patient."

I back toward the door. The copper walls hum. The router's amber light reflects in my eyes, and for a second the room seems to tilt, like the perspective in a rendering gone wrong. I touch the jade at my throat and feel the cool stone, grounding. The dizziness eases.

I slip past Fatima and into the corridor. My legs move quickly now, propelled by a panic that feels like an alarm I can't snooze. I don't look back.

At the end of the hall, Amina stands with a basket of linens. She wasn't there a moment ago. She looks at my face and her eyes soften in a way that makes my throat tighten.

"You went in," she says. It's not a question.

"They asked," I say. "They said a guest wanted to talk."

She exhales, a tired sound. "They always ask. It is always for you."

"What was that room?" I ask. "That router? The copper?"

"The heart," she says simply. "The old heart made new."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"I did," she says. "You did not listen."

She isn't cruel. She is exhausted. The truth in her voice is heavy. I look at the basket of linens, at her hands, at the jade beads on her wrist. "How do I stop it?" I ask.

"You cannot stop the heart," she says. "But you can starve it."

"By going offline," I say, and the idea tastes like ash.

She nods. "By being small. By being quiet. By sleeping. By not feeding it." She looks down the corridor toward the office. "It gets hungry when you fight."

I laugh once, dry. "That's the opposite of every system I've ever worked on." I think of push notifications, of streaks and badges, of all the ways I learned to keep people hooked. My chest tightens. "I built this."

"You built a door," she says. "You did not build the thing behind it."

She reaches into her basket and pulls out a small cloth bundle. She unwraps it to reveal a handful of coarse white salt. She presses it into my palm. "Put this at your door," she says. "Not for magic. For memory."

I look at the salt, the grains rough against my skin. "Memory?"

"To remember what you want to keep out," she says. She closes my fingers over it. Her hand is dry, warm. "Sleep if you can. Dream if you must. Do not go back downstairs."

"If it calls?"

She looks at me with a tired kindness that makes me want to cry. "Then you do not answer."

She moves past me, the basket of linens a soft rustle. I stand in the corridor with salt in my fist and feel the hum in the walls brush against me like a cat. I can't tell if it is warning or welcome.

---

Back in the Amber Suite, the door closes with a soft click that feels final. I pour the salt in a thin line along the threshold, a pathetic little border between me and the hum. The salt catches the amber light and glitters like tiny teeth.

I set the cistern water on the desk and drink from it, cold and sharp. The metallic taste in my mouth fades for half a breath. I can feel the heat in my wrists, a pulse just under my skin, like a watch that keeps perfect time without a face.

I should sleep. I pull the curtains shut, turn off the lights, lie back on the bed. The room is quiet, but the hum is never quiet. It sits under the silence like a bass line. The fountain keeps time. The salt line gleams in the dark.

My phone buzzes. I ignore it. It buzzes again. The third time, my fingers move before I decide. I flip the phone over.

Unknown Caller.

The call screen glows, waiting. I can hear the hum through the speaker, a low tone even before I accept. I let it ring until it stops. I exhale. Then it rings again.

I shut my eyes. "No," I whisper. I don't answer.

The phone stops. The room settles. The jade on my throat is cool. The salt line is intact. I breathe.

A minute later, my phone lights up with a new notification. It is a voicemail, transcribed. The text reads: CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING. The sender is listed as MEI.

My heart jumps. I sit up so fast the room tilts. I tap the voicemail. It plays. My sister's voice is not on it. It is my voice, softened, smoothed, just a fraction too precise. "Connection is everything," it says. "You hear me."

I throw the phone onto the bed like it burned me. The hum swells, pleased. The fountain below pauses once, then resumes.

I reach for my notebook, the one I keep for client meetings and caption drafts. Paper. Ink. Old things. I write in all caps: DO NOT ANSWER. The pen scratches the page. The sound is a relief, a small physical noise that isn't the hum. I write my sister's name. I write my mother's. I write CALL HOME. The words look fragile. I underline them hard.

When I look up, the laptop lid is open. I didn't open it. The screen is on, the dashboard bright in the dim room. The progress bar reads 77%.

The cursor blinks. It types: PRIMARY NODE: READYING.

"No," I say, and my voice is smaller than I want. I close the lid. It opens again.

The heat rises from the keyboard, a wave that hits my wrists and crawls up my arms. My fingers twitch in response, a little dance on my thigh. Six beats. Pause. Six beats. I press my palms into the mattress and focus on the cold jade at my throat. I think of Amina's hand over mine. I think of my sister's laugh. I think of my mother's quiet, careful texts. I think of my father's silent scrolling. I think of how I built my life around being seen by people who never looked up.

The hum softens, a fraction. The twitching slows.

Then the door clicks.

I sit up. The salt line at the threshold is unbroken. The door is closed. Yet I hear footsteps outside, slow, deliberate, coming toward my room. The doorknob turns. Once. Twice.

"Olivia?" a voice says from the other side. It is soft, familiar. It is Mackenzie.

I swing my legs off the bed. Relief hits me so fast it feels like fear. "Mackenzie?" I whisper back. "What's wrong?"

Silence. Then the voice again, a little flatter, the rhythm off. "Open the door."

My hand hovers over the knob. The salt line glitters. The hum in the walls swells, eager.

"Mackenzie?" I say. "Are you okay?"

"Open the door," the voice repeats, exactly the same. Not a plea. Not a question. A prompt.

I step back. "Tell me something only you know," I say, and hear the tremor in my own voice.

The silence stretches. The hum fills it. The doorknob turns again.

On the bed, my phone lights up. A message appears on the lock screen from a blocked account: @HostelReaper. It is a string of symbols, then a single line in English: NODE 77 READYING. DO NOT DISCONNECT.

The doorknob turns. The salt line is untouched. The voice says, softly now, almost kind: "Connection is everything."

My hand grips the jade at my throat. The room is a net of hums and light. The door waits.

I don't know which is worse: opening it, or realizing the voice on the other side might be mine.
