# Chapter 22: Dead Zone

I tried to turn on Airplane Mode and my phone asked if I wanted to connect to the nearest tower.

The toggle slid, the little airplane icon appeared, and then the screen flashed once, like a blink. The icon faded. The Wi-Fi symbol reappeared, full bars, smug as ever. I could have sworn the phone got warmer in my hand, as if it enjoyed winning.

I stared at it anyway. I was the kind of person who kept tapping a vending machine that ate my dollar. I was the kind of person who would rather believe the machine was broken than accept it was hungry.

Mackenzie sat on the bed behind me, scrolling through her camera roll with a blank face, the way you do when you want to look at anything except the disaster unfolding in front of you. The room hummed. The amber light was thicker now, like the air had been dyed.

“I’m going up,” I said.

“Up where?”

“Rooftop,” I said. “If there’s any place to break signal, it’s up.”

Mackenzie nodded, slow. “And if there isn’t?”

“Then there isn’t,” I said. I tried to sound like a person who accepted uncertainty. I was not that person.

I grabbed the jade beads from the bedside table. They were cool in my palm, almost cold. I slipped them around my wrist. They looked like a fashion choice, not a talisman. I told myself that if they didn’t work, I could at least pretend they were a new accessory for my next post.

We took the stairs instead of the elevator. The stairwell smelled like lemon polish and copper. The light fixtures hummed. The stone was cool under my fingertips as I trailed the wall for balance, the way you do when you’re a little dizzy and don’t want to admit it.

At the rooftop door, there was a sign: ROOFTOP TERRACE — OPEN 8AM-10PM. The clock on my phone read 8:03. The door handle was already warm.

We pushed it open and walked into light.

The rooftop was a mirage. Terracotta tiles, low cushions in jewel tones, a line of laundry drying in the breeze. Beyond the parapet, the medina sprawled, ochre and dusty, the Atlas Mountains hazy in the distance. The sun was already hot, the sky already a blue that never felt honest. The air smelled like dust and charcoal and someone’s coffee.

It should have been a relief. It should have been a clean signal. Instead the hum sharpened, turning high, like a dog whistle in my skull. The Wi-Fi symbol in my vision was not a symbol. It was a feeling. It was the way my teeth buzzed.

“Do you feel that?” I asked.

Mackenzie swallowed. “Yeah.”

We walked to the far corner where the building dropped down to the alley. A satellite dish leaned against a wall, its cable running down into the stone. The dish looked like a black flower. I sat beside it and slid down the wall, knees drawn up.

“Okay,” I said. “We’re in the open. Thick walls behind us. Air between us and the router. If this doesn’t help, then it’s not a signal problem. It’s… something else.”

Mackenzie snorted. “You mean a djinn.”

“I mean something else,” I said. I couldn’t say the word.

I pulled out my phone and tried again. Airplane Mode. It blinked off. I turned the phone off. It turned itself on. I took out the SIM card. The phone displayed full bars anyway, like it didn’t need a carrier. The network name floated at the top of the screen: أنا أسمعك.

I tucked the phone under the jade beads, as if jade could absorb signal. I didn’t know. I didn’t believe. I did it anyway.

Mackenzie picked at a loose thread on the cushion. “We should go to the police,” she said.

“And say what?” I asked. “My Wi-Fi won’t let me leave.”

“They’ll say you’re crazy,” she said.

“Exactly.”

She chewed her lip. “Then we should go to the embassy. You’re American. Your passport is American.”

“That’s in Rabat,” I said automatically. “And I can’t get into a taxi without my body rebooting.”

She looked at me, the question in her eyes: then what?

I didn’t have a roadmap for supernatural corporate interference. I had a process for user flows and a list of deliverables. I had the habit of making checklists when I was scared. I pulled my notebook from my bag and wrote, in neat block letters: ESCAPE PLAN.

1. Dead zone (rooftop) — test.
2. Embassy — consider.
3. Basement — investigate.
4. Amina — find.

The list looked ridiculous on the page. It also looked like something I could do.

Mackenzie watched me write it. “You’re making a project plan for a haunting,” she said.

“Data doesn’t lie,” I said, and laughed despite myself. The laugh came out wrong, like a cough. Dark humor was all I had left. It tasted like copper.

On the rooftop, the call to prayer floated from a nearby minaret. The sound rolled over the city, long and mournful. It was beautiful. It was not for me. I felt a sudden, sharp envy for people who could answer a call that wasn’t a notification.

My phone buzzed, even in my lap. A new message, no sender. The screen lit itself.

WELCOME TO THE PREMIUM NETWORK.

That was it. No buttons, no options. A push notification like a greeting card in the mail you didn’t ask for. I deleted it. It reappeared. I deleted it again. It reappeared with a new line:

CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING.

I dropped the phone. It hit the tile with a dull clack. The buzz continued in the stone.

Mackenzie stared at it, then at me. “Okay,” she said quietly. “Maybe the basement.”

We stood. The sun had warmed the tiles under my bare soles. The heat seeped up my legs, and for a second the sensation felt like the keyboard, like the first time my fingertips touched the warm keys and I hadn’t yet understood what they meant. I pulled my shoes back on.

We went down.

---

The staff door at the ground floor said خاص in white paint. PRIVATE. It sat just past reception, set into a wall of carved plaster like a mouth that didn’t open. I’d walked past it a dozen times, always turning away at the last moment, always respecting the rule because I assumed the rule would respect me back.

Mackenzie hovered at the edge of the courtyard as if she might run. “You’re sure?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “I’m desperate.”

The café was full. The same laptop glow, the same slack shoulders, the same smiles at screens. Amina—Amina-in-name-only—poured tea with perfect precision. Fatima answered questions at the desk with her serene smile. The night manager stood in the corner, hands folded, watching the fountain like it was a clock.

My stomach tightened. The hum behind the walls deepened. The jade beads on my wrist felt heavier than before.

“Go,” I whispered to Mackenzie. “Stand by the gate. If I come running, run with me.”

She didn’t argue. She moved to the edge of the courtyard, near the sunlit doorway to the street. Her eyes didn’t leave me.

I walked to reception. Fatima’s smile brightened by a fraction. “Miss Chen,” she said. “We hope you are enjoying your morning.”

“It’s great,” I lied. “Quick question: I need to access the laundry.”

She tilted her head. “It is available from noon to two.”

“I have a stain,” I said. “Work emergency. Can I go now?”

Her eyes did not change. “We will have a staff member assist you.”

“Actually, I can handle it,” I said. “I don’t want to bother anyone.”

Her smile sharpened. “We insist.”

A shadow detached from the wall. The night manager approached. He carried a ring of keys that did not clink. He held them out like an offering.

“Of course,” he said. “This way.”

My pulse spiked. I had expected to sneak. I had not expected to be escorted. I followed him past the staff door. The key turned with a soft, oiled sound. The door opened onto a narrow corridor that smelled of damp stone and something metallic.

“Laundry is down,” he said. “Please be quick.”

I nodded, and descended.

The stairs to the basement were steep and uneven. The air cooled as I went down, thicker, damp. The hum of the network grew louder, not in my ears but in my bones. A copper taste bloomed on my tongue. I gripped the banister to steady myself. The jade beads pressed into my wrist.

At the bottom, the corridor opened into a chamber. It was part storage room, part server room, part shrine. The old cistern had been converted into a rack of blinking machines, cables running like roots along the stone. Copper pipes lined the walls, glowing faintly in the low light. The air smelled of ozone and wet stone and something sweet, like honey burnt on a stove.

I stood at the threshold, heart hammering. The night manager remained at the top of the stairs, a silhouette. I felt the door at my back like a closing mouth.

Laundry machines sat along one wall, their digital screens dark. I walked to them, opened one, closed it. The metal was warm. The warmth lingered on my fingertips.

There were voices in the hum, or my brain heard voices in the hum. A low murmur, a chorus just below language. My skin prickled. I took a step toward the server rack. The blinking lights pulsed in a rhythm that matched the fountain upstairs, the six beats and pause. The geometry on the walls of the cistern, old plaster carved long before Wi-Fi, looked like circuit diagrams.

A folded cloth sat on a shelf. I unfolded it and found an old brass bowl, tarnished, lined with a thin layer of ash. Beside it, a paper scrap with Arabic script, and beneath that, something I recognized: a jade bead, identical to the ones on my wrist.

My throat tightened. Amina had been here. She had left this. Protection rituals, not superstitions. The system was ancient enough to have rules. Maybe protection was one of them.

I slipped the jade bead into my pocket. It felt like stealing, like trespassing on a prayer. I looked around for more—more proof, more answers. There were none.

I reached out and touched the copper pipe. The metal pulsed with heat, like a heartbeat under my palm. A shiver ran up my arm. The pipe hummed and, for a second, I could see it—light moving through it, amber currents flowing like blood.

I jerked my hand away. The pipe cooled. The hum quieted.

“Miss Chen,” the night manager called from the stairs. “Is everything in order?”

“Fine,” I said. My voice bounced off the stone. “Just—finding a coin.”

I didn’t even have coins. The lie was automatic.

I stepped back, and my heel knocked the brass bowl. It rang, a low, warm note that vibrated up my bones. The hum answered, rising in pitch. The server lights flickered. In the reflection of the copper pipe, I saw my own eyes, and for a second the geometric lines were vivid, bright as neon. My breath caught.

I turned and walked quickly to the stairs. I could feel the basement behind me, alive, listening. At the top, the night manager waited. He did not ask what I’d seen. He did not ask what I’d taken. He smiled and closed the door behind me.

Back in the courtyard, the air felt thin. The light felt brighter. Mackenzie was at the gate, arms folded tight, eyes searching me. I crossed the tiles and she met me halfway.

“Anything?” she asked.

“A bowl,” I said. “A bead. The servers are… alive.”

She blinked. “A bowl?”

“Like a ritual bowl,” I said. “Amina was down there. She had… a setup. It’s not just tech.”

Mackenzie’s eyes flicked to the staff. “They let you go down there?”

“I think they wanted me to,” I said. The thought chilled me.

“Okay,” she said, voice thin. “Then what?”

I pulled the jade bead from my pocket and pressed it between us. “Maybe this,” I said. “Maybe a ritual. Maybe a shield. Maybe—”

“I’m not a witch,” Mackenzie said.

“Me neither.” I slipped the bead back. “But I am out of options.”

We went upstairs, back into the amber room. The laptop waited, open, the screen black, as if it had been sleeping. I placed the jade bead on the keyboard, between the keys. It looked absurd, a small green dot against black plastic. I left it there, like an offering.

“Okay,” I said. “We do it the old way. No devices. No Wi-Fi. We wait it out.”

Mackenzie crossed her arms. “For how long?”

“Until it gives up,” I said. The idea of waiting for a network to give up was as ridiculous as waiting for hunger to get bored.

I powered down the laptop. The screen went dark. It stayed dark. A small victory. I slid my phone into a drawer. I sat on the bed and stared at the wall, at the carved plasterwork, at the geometric patterns that had always been there but now felt like eyes.

We waited.

---

The waiting lasted eleven minutes before I broke it with a plan that pretended to be casual. “Let’s go to the café,” I said. “If I can connect to the public network, maybe the premium one will drop. Like switching frequencies.” It sounded like a thing I could pitch in a meeting. It was a thing I wanted to believe.

Mackenzie didn’t argue. We went downstairs together, the way you go to the hospital with someone even though you know you can’t help.

The café was full in a way that felt rehearsed. People sat with perfect posture, screens angled for the light, cups placed at photogenic distances. A few glanced up as we entered, then returned to their keyboards with the same synchronized shift of attention. It made my skin prickle.

At a corner table, a guy with bleached hair and a sagging backpack waved at Mackenzie. “Hey,” he said. “You’re the TikTok girl, right?” His accent was Dutch. His name was Jasper, if I remembered her frantic whispers from last night.

“We’re trying to leave,” Mackenzie said without preamble. “The Wi-Fi—”

Jasper laughed as if she had told a joke. “Oh, the premium one? It’s crazy fast. I tried to tether and my phone got hotter than my stove.” He said it like a traveler brag. He said it like heat was a perk.

I sat down anyway. “Can I see?” I asked, sliding into the chair across from him. It was a rude ask. It was desperate.

He handed me his phone. The screen was warm. The network list blinked once and collapsed, leaving a single option. The same Arabic name, the same full bars. I toggled Airplane Mode. It snapped back off. I held the power button. The screen dimmed, then flared, like it had taken a breath. I handed it back. My fingertips tingled.

Jasper didn’t seem alarmed. “Maybe it’s just like that here,” he said. “You know, thick walls, metal, old buildings.” He smiled. “It’s kind of cool. Feels like the building has its own vibe.”

Mackenzie shot me a look. I looked away.

“Do you ever feel…” I searched for a word that didn’t sound insane. “Tethered?”

Jasper shrugged. “I feel like I have a better signal than I do at home. That’s the dream, right?” He glanced at my wrist. “Cool beads. Are those like, a thing?”

“Amina,” Mackenzie said. She sounded tired. “She gave them to us.”

Jasper nodded, as if that explained it. “The cleaner? She’s sweet. Always says stuff in riddles.” He went back to his screen. “I’m editing a vlog. Wanna see?”

He turned his laptop toward us. The footage was of the rooftop, the fountain, the courtyard. The same shots I had taken, the same angles, the same light. His edits were clean, saturated. His voiceover was smooth, generic. The captions were already there. I watched my own footage play back through someone else’s filter, and a laugh slipped out of me, thin and bitter.

“We’re all making the same video,” I said.

“That’s what gets views,” Jasper said. He tapped the trackpad and the video exported instantly. “The algorithm likes consistency. Give it what it wants.”

The hum under the tiles shifted, low and approving.

I pulled out my phone. My instinct was to post, to ask, to turn fear into content because content was the only language I knew. I opened my story, lifted the camera. The courtyard behind me looked too perfect, the amber light flattering my skin, the blue tiles singing. I started to type: “Anyone ever felt weird energy in their hostel? Need advice.” My thumbs froze. The words erased themselves. New words appeared: “Morning glow + mint tea = the perfect reset.” A row of sparkle emojis. A location tag I hadn’t added.

I swiped it away. It posted anyway.

“No,” I whispered.

Within seconds, hearts fluttered up the screen. “Love this vibe.” “So peaceful.” “Your energy is different lately.” Then a new account viewed the story, one I didn’t recognize. The handle was @HostelReaper. No profile photo. No posts. Just a view and a single DM: “Connection is everything.”

My stomach dropped. The phone buzzed in my hand, warm as a pulse. I shoved it into my pocket as if that could stop it listening.

Mackenzie leaned close. “What?” she asked.

“Nothing,” I said. “Let’s go.”

As we left, I glanced back at Jasper. He was already typing again, face lit by his screen, lips moving in a silent rhythm. His fingers moved with a precise cadence, six beats, pause, six beats. The same rhythm as the fountain. The same rhythm as my hands had used last night. He didn’t look up when we walked away.

Upstairs, the door to the Amber Suite was ajar. I was sure I had closed it. The room felt warmer than before, like a body had been sleeping there.

---

The room was too quiet without the hum. It was the kind of quiet that feels like holding your breath. The fountain still ran, the city still moved, but the room itself seemed to pause, like a network in sleep mode. My mind did not pause. It spun.

To keep from unraveling, I told myself a story about my mother.

When I was six, she bought me a purple plastic laptop that taught the alphabet. I typed my name, and the screen lit up and said, “Hello, Olivia.” I told my mother, wide-eyed, that it knew me. She laughed, but she also sat down and taught me that machines only know what you give them. She had left China with a suitcase and an engineering degree, and she believed in inputs and outputs like scripture. She believed in control.

She called last week. I hadn’t picked up. I had been editing a reel, tweaking the lighting so my skin looked more sun-kissed, less exhausted. I texted her later: “Busy. In Morocco. Will call soon.” She sent a heart emoji and a photo of her new garden. I told myself I would call after the presentation. After the next client. After the next post.

I opened the drawer. My phone was cold against my fingers. I didn’t want to turn it on. I turned it on.

It lit immediately, no boot screen, as if it had never been off. The Wi-Fi icon pulsed. I ignored it. I tapped my mother’s name. The call screen opened. It rang once. It went to voicemail.

“Hi, Olivia,” her voice said, the same calm warmth I had grown up with. “I missed your call. I’m in the garden. Call me when you can.”

I listened to it twice, the way you replay a song when you want to believe it means something. The copper taste rose in my mouth. The hum returned, low and steady, like the network had leaned in to listen.

Mackenzie watched me from the bed. “You okay?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “But I’m going to be.”

She looked at the jade bead on the keyboard. “It’s not working.”

“I know,” I said. I placed the phone face down. The moment I set it down, my laptop screen lit. I hadn’t touched it. The screen glowed amber. The jade bead sat on the keyboard like a green eye.

A window opened on the laptop. It wasn’t a program I recognized. It was a live feed. My own face filled the screen, slightly delayed, looking down at itself. The camera light was not on. There was no indicator. I raised my hand and the image raised its hand a half-second later, like a puppet.

I snapped the laptop shut. The hum spiked. The lid pressed against something warm.

Mackenzie stood. “We can’t stay,” she said. “We have to try the gate again, with the bead. Maybe it shields you enough to walk out.”

I didn’t want to go to the gate. I didn’t want to feel the tether tighten. But I didn’t want to wait in the room while the network took me in a slow, polite spiral. I grabbed the bead and slipped it under my tongue, the way people hide contraband. It tasted like stone.

We walked down to the courtyard again. The staff smiled, the guests typed, the fountain kept time. Mackenzie took my elbow and steered me toward the gate. I counted my breaths. I tried to hold on to the bead with my tongue.

At the threshold, I stepped into the sunlight. The vibration slammed into me like a wave. My knees buckled. Mackenzie held me. The bead clacked against my teeth.

“No,” I whispered.

“Come on,” she said. “Come on, just one step.”

I tried. The world tilted. A veil of geometric lines slid over my vision, crisp and bright, like a filter. My throat tightened. The hum became a roar.

I pulled back. The vibration eased.

Mackenzie’s eyes filled. “It’s not just you,” she said. “It’s—”

“Me,” I said. “It is me.” The truth sat heavy and bitter. The network wasn’t blocking the door. It was holding onto me.

We retreated. The staff did not stop us. The night manager watched, his hands folded, his smile serene, as if observing a tutorial.

Back upstairs, my laptop was open again. The screen displayed a schedule, a clean list of tasks with times and checkmarks. It looked like my calendar. It wasn’t my calendar. The top line read: PRIMARY NODE CALIBRATION — 11:59 PM.

“Calibration,” I said. The word landed like a joke.

Mackenzie read it. “Midnight,” she said. “That’s tonight.”

I nodded. My mouth tasted like jade and copper. “We have hours,” I said. “We can still—”

“Stop saying that,” she snapped. “We’re out of hours.”

We sat on the bed, watching the schedule like it was a countdown to a launch. The sun slid down the walls, the room turning deeper amber. The carved plasterwork cast longer shadows, more intricate patterns. The hum under the floorboards synchronized with my heartbeat, and I couldn’t tell where my body ended and the network began.

“I’m going to sleep,” I said. It was a lie. It was a plan. It was an attempt to not think.

Mackenzie nodded and curled up on the other side of the bed, back to me, like a barrier. The jade bead burned against my tongue. I slid it out and put it on the nightstand. It looked small, stupid, helpless. I closed my eyes.

The geometry bloomed behind my eyelids, slow and precise. The lines rotated. The shapes folded. The hum became a voice, low and amused. It said nothing I could understand, but my body understood anyway. My fingers twitched.

I opened my eyes. The laptop was open. I didn’t remember opening it. My hands were on the keyboard. They were moving. The keys clicked in a rhythm that matched the fountain, six beats, pause, six beats. The screen filled with text in a language I did not know, then with lines of code that flowed like water. The jade bead sat on the desk, untouched.

“Stop,” I whispered.

My fingers didn’t stop.

Mackenzie woke with a gasp. “Olivia?” she said.

“I’m not—” I said. My voice was calm, my body was not. I was a passenger in my own hands. “I didn’t—”

The screen flashed. A message appeared in my browser window, a simple line on a white background:

NODE ONLINE.

Under it, a countdown: 00:10:00.

“What is that?” Mackenzie asked.

I tried to lift my hands. They lifted, a fraction, and slammed back down. It was like pushing against a magnet. The heat from the keys seeped into my palms, soft and sticky, a warm honey that clung.

“We have ten minutes,” I said. The words came out hollow. “We have ten minutes to—”

To what? To run? To pray? To click a button? I didn’t know. The hum rose, the amber light thickened, the carved patterns on the wall sharpened, and my fingers kept typing, faster, more precise.

Mackenzie grabbed my shoulders, tried to pull me back. My body resisted. My joints felt locked. The countdown ticked down: 09:59, 09:58.

I looked at the screen. I looked at my hands. I looked at the door.

“Don’t leave me,” I said, and it sounded like a joke until I heard the panic underneath it. It sounded like a request I was not allowed to make.

Mackenzie’s eyes were wet. “I’m not,” she said. “I’m right here.”

The hum deepened. The amber light pooled around my wrists. Somewhere in the building, the fountain shifted its rhythm, quickening by a fraction. The countdown reached 09:50.

My hands kept typing.
