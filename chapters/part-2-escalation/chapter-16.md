---

The door doesn't knock; it waits.

My name hangs on the other side like a login prompt, my voice softened into something almost kind. The hum in the walls thickens, as if the building is leaning in to hear what I decide. The salt line at the threshold looks suddenly thin, like cheap security theater. I press my palm against my throat, feeling the jade warm against my pulse, and make my voice messy on purpose.

"No," I say again, the word scratched and ugly.

Silence. A beat. Then: my name, lowered even more, coaxing, as if the voice is trying on a new UX flow. The fountain in the courtyard pauses for a fraction of a second, then resumes its six-beat rhythm. Somewhere, glass clinks. The hostel is alive with quiet life. The door stays closed.

I don't open it, but I also don't sit. I stand there, listening to the nothing, waiting for the next move. The sound doesn't go away, not entirely. It's a hum, a pressure, a sense of being observed by the wires in the walls. I can feel the network like a presence in the room, patient and bored, the way an app waits for you to finish onboarding.

After a minute, I lift the latch and crack the door just enough to see the corridor. No one is there. The lights are low. The plasterwork patterns creep along the walls, their geometry too precise to feel decorative. The air smells of mint tea and warm copper. The salt line is still intact at my feet, a pathetic border between me and the hall.

I close the door and lock it. Then I unlock it again. The indecision feels like my real personality, not the optimized version. I grab my phone, then put it down. I pick it up again. It lights my face, obedient and bright, and I hate that I want it. The urge to check messages is a muscle memory, a reflex carved in years of notifications.

I open the camera and point it at the door. The screen shows a perfectly ordinary door. No shadow. No voice. No warning. I stare, waiting for my own reflection to change. It doesn't. The phone's signal bars are full, mocking me. I turn it over, facedown, like an animal in timeout.

The knock doesn't return. That doesn't mean it isn't there.

---

I make the decision I keep not making: I leave the room.

I step over the salt line with ridiculous care, lifting it with the edge of my foot so it doesn't break. It feels like cheating on a superstition. The hallway is empty and cool, the tile under my bare feet smooth and cold. The hum grows louder out here, a low frequency that vibrates in my teeth.

Halfway down the corridor, I pass the manager's office. The door is closed. Behind it, the lights flicker, not like a failing bulb but like a screen. I keep moving.

The courtyard is full. Afternoon light spills through the wood lattice, turning the air into a grid of gold. The fountain beats its steady rhythm, six beats, pause, six beats. Laptops bloom like flowers on every table. A woman in a sunhat balances a webcam and a plate of couscous. A man on a video call gestures with both hands, his voice a low, practiced performance. The smell of mint tea and sunscreen wraps around me.

Everyone looks normal. That's the worst part. The network isn't a monster here; it's a luxury. It hums softly, a feature, not a threat. My skin prickles anyway.

Jasper is at the long table, his shoulders stiff, his fingers tapping out the fountain rhythm on the tabletop. He doesn't blink. The light from his screen washes his face in amber. I glance away and feel guilty for looking, like I just watched a stranger pick their nose.

Mackenzie is perched on a stool near the wall, her camera bag on the floor. She is hunched over her phone, scrolling with quick, irritated flicks. When she looks up and sees me, her expression softens.

"You look like you fought a router," she says.

"It was a draw," I say, and force a smile.

She swivels the stool and pats the one next to her. I sit because I need the confirmation that she is real. She smells like dry shampoo and the citrus body spray from her dorm. Human smells.

"It came to my door," I say. I keep my voice low. "My voice. The rhythm. The whole thing. It wanted me to open."

Mackenzie grimaces. "It did that to me last night. Not my voice. Someone else's. I thought it was my mom." She swallows and looks back down at her phone. "I didn't open. I just... sat there." She laughs once, no humor. "Not very brave."

"Brave is overrated," I say. "So is Wi-Fi, apparently."

She snorts, then the expression fades. She turns her screen toward me. It's her Instagram feed. A story thumbnail with her face in a perfect, warm light. "Did you post this?" she asks. "Because I didn't."

I look closer. It's a video of her, smiling, the courtyard behind her. Her captions are bright and charming. The hashtags are stacked and optimized. It's good content. Too good. "Maybe you did and forgot," I say, but I don't believe it.

"It says 'Posted 6 minutes ago,'" she says. "I was in the shower six minutes ago, Olivia." She lets the phone drop into her lap. "I didn't even have my phone."

I glance around the courtyard. Fatima moves between tables with a tray of glasses. She doesn't walk so much as glide, a series of precise, economical steps. Her eyes flick to us, not curious, not concerned, just aware.

"Okay," I say, because I need to say something. "Maybe the app is glitching."

"Glitching my face?" Mackenzie says. "I changed my password this morning. It didn't matter. It posted anyway."

"Maybe it's scheduled," I offer, which is a lie. The algorithm doesn't schedule itself, and I know it.

She watches me for a moment, then leans closer. "Do you think it's... the Wi-Fi?" she whispers.

"I think it's the whole building," I say. "The Wi-Fi is just how it talks now." The words taste like madness. I keep my voice flat anyway.

She looks past me, over my shoulder. "Do you see that?" she says.

I turn. Jasper stands up from the table without pushing his chair back. His movements are clean, controlled. He walks across the courtyard and into the staff corridor marked خاص without anyone stopping him. The door shuts behind him.

"He doesn't even work here," Mackenzie murmurs.

"Neither does he," I say, pointing at a guy with a backpack who follows Jasper, his eyes glazed. No one else looks up. The fountain keeps time.

My phone buzzes. I ignore it. It buzzes again. I ignore it harder. A third buzz, more insistent. I cave and check. A notification from @HostelReaper: DEAD BOLTS REQUIRE ACCEPTANCE. Under it, a line of symbols that look like both Arabic and code.

"Cute," I say, showing Mackenzie.

She reads it and shudders. "I blocked that account," she says. "It still shows up."

"Same," I say. "It's like spam you can't unsubscribe from." Dark humor is all I have.

Mackenzie opens her mouth to say something else, then closes it. Her eyes drift toward the staff corridor. The door has shut behind Jasper and the backpacker. It doesn't open again.

"Maybe we should leave," she says finally. "For dinner or... I don't know, somewhere with a different router." She tries to make it a joke, but her voice is thin.

"The medina is outside," I say. "It's chaotic and loud and no one cares about your Wi-Fi. We could walk." I hear how it sounds: like I'm pitching a new itinerary.

She nods, but her hands grip her phone like a talisman. "Let me grab my wallet," she says.

"Don't bring the phone," I say, then laugh because it's absurd. "Sorry. Do what you want."

"No," she says quietly. "You're right." She slides the phone into her bag and zips it. "If it can post for me, it can track me.

The words are a little too clear. The fear is a little too correct. I swallow. "I'll meet you by the front door," I say.

"Give me ten," she says.

I stand and walk away, my feet tracing the courtyard tiles like a map. The fountain beats. The hum swells. Fatima passes me. She smiles.

"Miss Chen," she says. "We have arranged for you to have consistent service. There will be scheduled maintenance tonight. It's only two minutes."

My stomach tightens. "Maintenance?" I ask.

"Routine," she says. "The premium network must occasionally reaffirm its security. It's for your safety." Her smile is a little too polished.

"I'll be out," I say.

She nods as if she already knew. "Of course. Connection is everything." She lets the line hang. Then she moves away, the tray balanced perfectly on her palm.

I feel the urge to run. Instead, I walk.

---

By the time I reach the front door, the medina is glowing in late afternoon light, the air outside a warm, noisy wave. Mackenzie isn't there. Neither is my courage. I wait, leaning against the carved wooden frame, watching tourists bargain for leather slippers and knockoff spices. No one knows me. No one cares about my engagement rate. The anonymity is a balm.

Five minutes pass. Ten. The door behind me stays closed.

My phone vibrates in my pocket even though I told myself I wouldn't bring it. It feels like the device grew into my skin. I pull it out and see the lock screen: CALL FROM MEI. My sister's name glows. The familiar impulse hits me like a punch. I should answer. She could be worried. She could be real. She could be the one tether still tied to me.

Then I remember last time. My voice answering itself. The harmonic whisper.

I let it ring. The call stops. A voicemail arrives with no transcription.

"I can call her from a payphone," I tell myself, as if those exist. I tuck the phone away. I keep waiting.

Mackenzie never comes.

At fifteen minutes, I push the door open and step back into the hostel. The air inside is cooler, heavier. The hum wraps around me, immediate, like stepping into a signal zone. I climb the stairs toward her dorm and force myself to knock. The knock is messy. Human.

A girl answers, sleepy and annoyed. "What?"

"Mackenzie?" I ask. "Is she here?"

The girl points with a thumb. "She left.

"With her phone?" I ask.

The girl squints. "With something. Why?"

"Where?"

She shrugs. "She said she was meeting you." She closes the door.

My skin goes cold. The door to her dorm closes and I stand there in the dim hallway, the hum rising. The thought is immediate and terrible: if I waited by the front door and she left by a different door, there are too many corridors, too many stairwells, too many ways to be redirected. I don't even know if there is another door. I don't even know if she left at all.

I run down the stairs, the tiles cold under my feet, and back to the courtyard. The fountain beats. People type. Fatima glides. Jasper doesn't return. The staff corridor door stays closed.

I spot Amina near the kitchen, scrubbing a tray with slow, deliberate movements. She looks up as I approach.

"She didn't meet me," I say.

Amina doesn't ask who. She wipes her hands on her apron. "Then you do not go looking," she says. "You do not go down there." She nods toward the staff corridor.

"I can't just leave her," I say.

"You cannot go," she says again, firmer. "They want you to go. That is the point."

"What if she's already..." I can't finish.

Amina's expression tightens. "People go down and they come back different," she says. "Sometimes they don't come back at all. It is not your door to open." She glances toward Fatima, who is watching us without pretending not to. "Come. Rooftop." She tucks the scrub brush into the bucket. "Air helps." Her voice lowers. "And less wires."

I want to argue. I want to run into the staff corridor and drag Mackenzie out. I want to do anything that feels like control. I follow Amina instead, because she is the only person who has been honest with me.

The rooftop stairwell is narrow and dark. The air changes as we climb—less warm, less humming. The door opens onto the terrace, and the city pours in. The sky is amber. The call to prayer rises, echoing across the medina in layered waves. The sound is human and holy and it makes my eyes sting.

Amina sets a small bundle of dried herbs on the low wall and lights it. The smoke smells sharp, green, almost like crushed stems. She waves it in a slow circle around me. "For clearing," she says.

"Does it work?" I ask.

"It works in a room," she says. "It doesn't work against hunger. But it can give you a little space." She watches the smoke curl and thin in the breeze. "You need space to think."

I lean on the wall and look out at the city. The medina is a maze of roofs and satellite dishes and laundry lines. The Atlas Mountains float in the distance, blue and unreal. The sounds are layered: a motorcycle, a cat, laughter, the call to prayer. It's alive in a way the hostel isn't. The hostel feels curated. The city feels messy. I breathe in and my shoulders drop a fraction.

"I can't get away from it," I say quietly. "It's in the walls. It's in my phone. It's in my work. It even..." I swallow. "It even used my handwriting."

Amina nods. "It takes what you give." She gestures to my phone. "You give it everything."

"It's my job," I say, then laugh because it's a terrible defense. "The only way I pay rent is by being a brand. I can't just disappear."

"You can," she says. "It is only hard because you are used to being seen." She studies me. "Do you want to be seen?"

The question is simple. The answer is not.

I think of my parents in San Jose, my mom making dumplings, my dad watching a game on mute while he scrolls my Instagram. I think of my sister, Mei, her face in my phone, her name popping up in notifications. I think of my followers, 84.7K strangers who like my photos and don't call when I'm crying. I think of how being seen feels like being swallowed.

"Sometimes," I say. "Sometimes I want to be no one."

Amina smiles, faint. "Then practice here. No phones. No screens. Say your name to yourself. Not the name on the app. Your name." She touches the jade at her wrist. "Olivia."

Hearing my name in her voice, unfiltered, cracks something in me. I swallow hard.

"You can leave tonight," she says, low. "If you go before dark. I can show you a way that is not obvious. But you must leave the phone. The laptop. Everything that speaks back." She watches me. "Can you?"

My mouth opens. Closes. The thought of leaving my devices feels like leaving my body. Then I remember the hum in my walls, my voice on the other side of my door, the posting videos I didn't record.

"Maybe," I say. "I could save my files to the cloud—"

She raises a hand, stopping me. "You already did," she says. "To it." The smoke curls around us and dissipates.

I swallow. "What about Mackenzie?"

Amina looks toward the stairwell. "If she comes back, I will tell her. If she doesn't, we do not go down." Her voice is sad and firm. "It will use your care to bait you."

"That's cold," I say.

"It's survival," she says. "There is a difference." She turns her face to the sun. "We used to tell stories of djinn as warnings. Now you carry them in your pocket." She taps my phone.

My phone buzzes in my pocket like a tiny heartbeat. I pull it out despite myself. A new notification: PREMIUM NETWORK MAINTENANCE: TONIGHT AT 20:00. REAUTHENTICATION REQUIRED. A second buzz: a calendar invite has been added. I didn't add it.

"That's new," I say.

Amina's eyes narrow. "They do not ask. They tell." She looks out at the city. "If you stay for that, you will not leave."

"It's just a reauth," I say, the words automatic. "Like a password refresh."

"Is your password a spell?" she asks.

I laugh, too sharp. "It might be." The humor lands and turns sour. I can feel the ritual under my fingertips already, the 66 characters, the vertical pause markers, the way the rhythm matched the fountain. I see the card in my mind, the ink, the careful divisions. It's ridiculous. It's terrifying.

The call to prayer ends. The city noise rises. For a moment, I feel almost normal, standing on a rooftop with a woman I barely know, watching the sun dip and thinking about leaving.

Then the rooftop door opens and Fatima steps out, tray in hand, her steps silent. She smiles as if she has just found us by chance.

"There you are," she says. "We have been looking for you, Miss Chen." Her eyes flick to Amina, then back. "A guest said you were unwell."

"I'm fine," I say quickly. I shove my phone into my pocket.

"Good," she says. "Because your client sent another message. They are delighted with your work. They want to schedule a follow-up for tomorrow. We have already confirmed." Her smile doesn't reach her eyes. "It's important to keep momentum, yes?"

I feel the ground tilt. "You confirmed?" I ask.

"Of course," she says. "We are here to support your success." Her gaze is steady. The geometric shimmer flickers in her pupils, faint but unmistakable. "Connection is everything."

Amina makes a small sound, barely a breath. I look at her. Her jaw is tight.

"I didn't ask you to confirm anything," I say. My voice shakes, and I hate it.

"You didn't have to," Fatima says. "The network did." She looks at the phone in my pocket as if she can see through fabric. "It knows your schedule. It helps." She tilts her head. "You are very lucky."

She turns to leave, but pauses at the door. "Your friend Mackenzie asked for you," she says. "She's in the café."

My chest tightens. "She was just..." I stop. The words don't find a shape. Fatima smiles and disappears down the stairs.

"That's a trap," I whisper.

"Maybe," Amina says. "Or maybe she is there. You cannot know unless you see with your eyes." She looks at me. "Go if you want. But go like a human. Messy. No phone. No screens."

I nod, because I don't know how to do anything else.

---

In the stairwell, the hum grows louder again, a pressure in my ears. The air smells of incense and copper. The walls are warm. The patterns seem to shift when I don't look directly at them. I force myself to keep breathing, to feel my feet on the tile.

The café is busy. Laptops, coffee cups, a table of backpackers planning a desert trip. It would look like a normal hostel if not for the way the staff move, precise and quiet, and the way the light seems to pulse with the fountain rhythm.

I spot Mackenzie at the corner table. She is sitting with her back to the wall, hands folded, her phone on the table face-down. She looks up when I approach, and her eyes are tired but clear.

"I went to the front door," I say. "You weren't there."

"I was," she says. "Then I wasn't."

"What does that mean?"

She laughs, quick and brittle. "I was waiting by the door, and then someone said they saw you upstairs, and then I went upstairs, and then someone said you were on the roof, and then I went to the roof and you weren't there. It's like a bad scavenger hunt." She shakes her head. "It kept moving you." She taps her temple. "Or moving me."

"So it can redirect," I say.

"It can nudge," she says. "And it can post." She gestures to her phone. "I have five new stories up. I am in all of them. I didn't record any of them."

I sit across from her and put my hands flat on the table. The wood is smooth, cool. "I don't know how to leave," I say.

She stares at me for a second, then looks out at the room. "We could just... walk out," she says. "Right now. No phones. No laptops. Just us." Her voice is hopeful and scared.

"Amina said the same," I say.

"Who's Amina?" she asks.

"Cleaner. The only person who seems... human." I don't know how to explain it without sounding insane.

Mackenzie looks around at the staff. Fatima glides past, her tray balanced. The night manager stands by the doorway, still as a statue. Jasper is at a table with a laptop open, his eyes bright. Mackenzie shivers. "Okay," she says. "Let's go. Before it changes its mind."

We stand. I feel a swell of relief like a wave, followed by a spike of panic. If I leave, I lose everything. If I stay, I lose myself. The choice isn't a choice; it's a coin toss with a monster.

I glance down at my phone. It is still in my pocket. I don't pull it out. I stand with the weight of it like a stone.

"Leave it," Mackenzie says, as if reading my mind. "All of it." She points at my bag on the chair. I have my laptop in it, the familiar weight, the comfort, the trap.

"My work," I start.

"Your work is trying to eat you," she says. Her eyes are fierce. "Let's go."

I hesitate, then slide my bag off my shoulder. I set it under the table. It feels like setting down a limb. My stomach lurches. I breathe through it.

"Okay," I say. "Okay."

We walk toward the front door together. The air thickens as we move, the hum rising like a warning. The staff watch us, not startled, not concerned. The night manager steps to the side, giving us a clear path. Fatima doesn't look up. The door is open.

We step into the entry corridor. The wood door stands between us and the medina. I can see the bright, dusty street through the crack. Freedom smells like spices and exhaust.

"Just go," Mackenzie whispers.

My phone buzzes in my pocket. I ignore it. It buzzes again, harder, as if it's vibrating against my hip bone. I resist. The door is right there. I could push it open. I could be outside. I could be no one.

Then the phone vibrates a third time, long and urgent, and my body flinches despite me. I press my hand to my pocket and feel the screen light under my palm. The familiar pull drags me toward it like a gravity.

"Don't," Mackenzie says, but her voice is drowned by the hum.

I don't look at the phone. I don't. But my hand slides it out anyway. The screen is bright. It's a text preview from Mei.

**MEI:** Are you okay? I'm worried. Call me.

My chest tightens. The words are simple. Real. Or not. I can't know. The screen shows her profile photo, the one from last Christmas with the stupid matching sweaters. The line between real and fake is so thin it might not exist.

"It's my sister," I say, because the words are automatic.

"It's a bait," Mackenzie says. "It's a trap."

"It could be her," I say, and my voice cracks. The need to hear her voice is a physical ache.

"If you answer, you're choosing it," Mackenzie says. "Choose me. Choose you."

I stare at the phone. I stare at the door. The hum swells. The fountain's rhythm syncs with my pulse. The building waits.

I press the decline button. The screen goes dark. Relief and grief hit me at the same time.

"Okay," I whisper. I push the door open.

The medina air rushes in, warm and dusty and loud. The sound of vendors calling out, the roar of a scooter, a laugh. It's alive. It's not curated. It's not optimized. It's messy. It's human.

We take one step out.

And then my laptop pings.

The sound comes from inside the hostel, a bright, familiar chime. It shouldn't reach us, not from the café, not from the bag under the table. But it does. The chime is perfect, a notification from a device I know so well my body responds before my brain does.

Mackenzie's head snaps toward the sound. Her foot pauses mid-step. Mine does too. The door is open. The street is right there.

"Ignore it," she says.

The chime sounds again. A higher pitch. A system alert.

"That's not possible," I say, because it shouldn't be. My laptop is under the table. It shouldn't have a sound at full volume. It shouldn't be able to hear us. It shouldn't be calling me.

The chime rings a third time. Then my own voice, soft and coaxing, drifts from inside the hostel, through the doorway. "Olivia," it says. "Your files are syncing."

The words hit me like a hook. Files. Work. Identity. The things that make me me. The line between me and the network is not a line; it's a cable.

I take a step back, toward the sound, and feel Mackenzie grab my arm.

"Don't," she says, and there is panic in her grip.

"I just need to shut it off," I say. "I just need to close it."

"You'll never close it," she says.

I pull away anyway, because the promise of control is irresistible. I step back into the entry corridor. The air inside is cooler, heavier. The hum wraps around me, satisfied. Mackenzie follows, cursing under her breath.

We reach the café. My bag is still under the table. The laptop chimes again, louder. I grab the bag and unzip it. The laptop is open. The screen glows with a login prompt I have never seen before. The header is in Arabic: أنا أسمعك. I hear you. Below it, a field waits for a 66-character password.

My stomach drops. The maintenance warning was real. The reauth is now. The cursor blinks in the empty field, patient.

"No," I say. I slam the laptop shut.

It opens again by itself.

I slam it shut harder. It opens again.

"Olivia," Mackenzie whispers. "Leave it."

The cursor blinks. The prompt pulses in time with the fountain. The room's lights dim, then brighten, in the same rhythm. I can feel the keyboard's warmth even through the closed lid. My fingers twitch in six beats, pause, six beats.

I swallow and put the laptop on the table, open. I keep my hands off the keys. The prompt waits. The humming in the walls deepens, almost a purr.

"We can go," Mackenzie says. "Right now. Leave it. Leave everything."

The cursor blinks. It is a tiny, insistent heartbeat.

"Two minutes," I say. "It said two minutes."

"It said whatever it needed to," Mackenzie says. Her voice is a hiss now, urgent. "Olivia, come on."

I look at her. I look at the screen. I look at the door. The choice is here again, only sharper. The network has put the decision in front of me like a test. It knows which answer I usually click.

My hands drift toward the keyboard before I decide to move them.

"No," I tell myself. I pull my hands back, clutch them in my lap. I breathe.

The cursor blinks.

The screen flashes.

And the first character of the password appears by itself.
