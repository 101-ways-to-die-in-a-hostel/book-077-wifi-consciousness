The doorknob turns like a slow download.

"Open the door," Mackenzie says on the other side, soft and flat, the same cadence as the notification voice on my phone.

The salt line at the threshold gleams in the amber light. The knob turns again, once, twice. The hum in the walls lifts, eager, a dog that heard its name.

"Tell me something only you know," I say, and my voice comes out smaller than the room.

Silence, thick and humming. Then, as if on a loop: "Open the door."

My hand hovers over the latch. The jade at my throat is cold. The jade on my wrist is colder. I remind myself of Amina's face when she said it: It listens there.

The hum thickens. The knob turns a third time. Not fast. Not angry. Just patient, like a system that knows you always eventually click accept.

"Mackenzie?" I say again, and hate how much I want it to be her. "What's my middle name?"

Another pause. The voice shifts, a fraction lower. "Olivia, please."

Dark humor floats up like bile. "If you're going to phish me, at least personalize it," I say, and then, because I am shaking, I add, "Try again tomorrow." I take a step back from the door and sit on the bed. The salt line stays unbroken. The knob stops turning.

I wait for it to knock. It doesn't. It just leaves, a soundless retreat down the hall that could be either footsteps or the hum inside my skull easing.

I stare at the door, heart stuttering in my throat. The note I wrote earlier in block letters - DO NOT ANSWER - flashes in my head. It feels less like a reminder and more like a plea.

I should stay inside. I know this. That’s the reasonable thing, the safe thing, the thing Amina told me. But my body is vibrating with questions. If it wasn't Mackenzie, who was it? If it was Mackenzie, what's happening to her? And if the network can sound like her now, how long until it sounds like me?

I slide out of bed and step over the salt line. I lift the edge of the line with my heel so I don’t break it, like I can outsmart a door with etiquette. The hall is empty. The lights are low. The plasterwork patterns climb the walls like a net of quiet geometry.

The air is cooler here, and it smells faintly of mint tea and copper. I move down the corridor toward the stairs, bare feet on cold tile, trying to stay quiet even though there’s no one to hear me. The hum follows anyway, a low bass line under my pulse.

Halfway down, I stop and listen. Nothing. No footsteps, no breath. Just the fountain's rhythm. Six beats, pause, six beats. I match my breathing to it without meaning to.

At the dorm hallway on the third floor, I pause again. The door to Mackenzie's room is ajar, a slice of darkness. I knock gently and push it open.

The dorm smells like socks and lavender and the citrusy spray someone uses to pretend the socks aren't there. A row of bunks lines the wall. Mackenzie is on the top bunk, a lump under a thin blanket, her hair a dark spill over the pillow. She is breathing, slow and even.

I whisper her name. She doesn't stir.

A girl on the lower bunk opens one eye, then both. She looks at me like I'm a raccoon in the kitchen. "It's four in the morning," she whispers, and rolls over.

"Sorry," I whisper back. I step closer to the bunk and try again. "Mackenzie." I touch her shoulder. It's warm. Real. She flinches and blinks, then focuses on me.

"Olivia?" she whispers. "What is it?"

"Did you just..." I glance at the doorway, the hall beyond. "Did you just knock on my door?"

She frowns. "No. I've been asleep. Are you okay?"

Her eyes are sleepy, unfocused. No lattice. No glow. A normal human face at an abnormal hour. Relief floods me so fast my knees wobble.

"I thought I heard you," I say.

"Not me," she whispers. She props herself up on her elbow. "Is it happening again?"

"I think so," I say.

She sits up further, blanket sliding down. She looks smaller in the dim light, more real. "It can mimic voices?"

"Apparently." I try for a laugh and fail. "It's like a deepfake with better customer service."

She doesn't smile. "That's not funny."

"I know." I lean my head against the bedpost. "I'm sorry."

"Do you want me to come to your room?" she asks.

I imagine the network on the other side of my door, patient. I imagine it hearing both of us, harvesting more voice, more patterns. "No," I say. "Stay here. I just wanted to make sure you were you." The words sound ridiculous even to me.

She studies me for a beat. "Okay," she says. "If it knocks again, don't open. That's basic horror movie rule."

"It already knocked," I say.

She pulls the blanket back up. "Then don't open again. Text me if you need me. Oh wait." She grimaces. "Text on what? The demon Wi-Fi?"

"I'll knock," I say.

"The human way," she whispers. "Random rhythm."

We share a thin, shaky laugh. I back out of the room, the door soft against the frame. I don’t turn my phone on. I don’t check the time. I walk back upstairs with the feeling of being watched by the walls themselves.

At my door, the salt line is still unbroken. I step over it, lift it, let it fall, ridiculous ritual. The room is dim, my bed rumpled, my laptop closed. The only light is the blinking dot on my phone screen.

There’s a new voicemail. Transcribed. The sender is MEI. The text reads: I KNOW IT'S LATE. OPEN THE DOOR.

My throat goes tight. I don’t hit play. I don’t have to. The message uses my sister's name like a key. I set the phone facedown and sit on the floor, back against the bed, staring at the salt line like it's a firewall.

The hum in the walls lowers to a purr. It will wait. It always waits.

---

Morning doesn't arrive so much as leak into the room. A pale, dusty light slips under the curtains and turns the dust into a field of glitter. I don't remember falling asleep. I remember closing my eyes and hearing my sister's name and then, suddenly, it is daylight.

I sit up too fast. My head feels heavy, as if something has been copying files in it all night. The jade at my throat is warm. The jade on my wrist is cool. The salt line is still in place. The laptop is open.

I close it. I don't check the screen. If I look, I know it'll be there. The progress bar. The words. The clean minimalist dashboard that I used to want to design.

My phone buzzes. I ignore it. It buzzes again. On the third buzz, I flip it over and see a notification from @HostelReaper. A string of symbols, then a line: SPOOFING ENABLED.

I toss the phone onto the bed like it's a snake. The humor in me wants to reply with a snarky thumbs-up. The fear in me wants to smash the phone in the sink and fill it with the cistern water until it short-circuits.

There's a soft knock at the door, random, uneven. A human rhythm. I open it without thinking.

Amina stands there with a basket of laundry balanced on her hip. She looks tired, her eyes red at the edges, but her posture is straight. The jade on her wrist catches the light.

"You did not sleep," she says.

"I did. I just don't remember it," I say. The words feel like a complaint and a confession.

She doesn't ask about the door or the voice. She doesn't need to. "Come," she says. "You said you want to be small. Be small with me." She gestures down the hallway.

I glance at the laptop, the phone, the bed. The pull of my devices is an ache in my chest. But the idea of doing something that doesn't involve them feels like oxygen.

"Okay," I say, and follow her.

The laundry room is in the staff corridor, past the door marked خاص. It's warmer there, the air thick with steam and soap. The machines are big and old, their drums the size of barrels. They are unplugged. Amina washes sheets by hand in a metal basin, her sleeves rolled up, her wrists wet and shiny. There is a bar of rough brown soap on the edge, and a bucket of water that smells faintly of copper.

She hands me a stack of pillowcases. "Wash," she says. "Not for them. For you." Her tone is gentle and firm. There's no room for debate.

I roll up my sleeves and plunge my hands into the basin. The water is cold, then warm. The soap is gritty. The fabric is rough and real. I scrub, and for a moment my brain empties out. There is only water and cloth and the rhythm of my own arms. It feels like the first time I've breathed in days.

The hum fades in the laundry room. Not gone, but muted, as if the thick walls and old pipes muffle it. I cling to the silence like a lifeline.

"Why does it sound like me?" I ask after a while. The question has been sitting on my tongue all night, sour.

Amina wrings a sheet with practiced hands. "It listens," she says. "It learns. The more you give, the more it wears." She glances at me. "The djinn were always like that. They borrow what you fear, and then they use it." She pauses. "Now it borrows your voice. Your name. The face you give to strangers online."

I think of my videos, my captions, my laugh that I use as punctuation. I think of the way I repeat phrases until they become catchphrases, until they are as recognizable as my face. "So I've been feeding it for years," I say.

"We all have," she says. "The building did not have these wires before. But it had other wires. Stories. Trade. Names." She dips another sheet into the basin. "It has always been hungry for connection. This is the newest way to eat." She says it matter-of-factly, like weather.

"Why doesn't it take you?" I ask. I look at her jade beads, the careful way she moves. "You've been here seventeen years. How did you not..." I trail off, because saying 'get eaten by the Wi-Fi' feels obscene.

She smiles, small. "I learned from my mother," she says. "And her mother learned from hers. This house has been hungry a long time. We did not call it Wi-Fi then." She holds up her wrist, the jade catching light. "This helped. And I did not use the machines." She glances toward the hallway, the world of phones and routers and humming walls. "But it learns. It is hungry. It grows."

"So I'm already..." I don't have a word. A file in transit. A username.

"Not yet," she says. "Not all. You are still here. But it is faster now. The copper makes it fast." She wrings the sheet harder, water splashing the floor. "They wanted it fast. They paid for it fast." Her mouth twists. "They asked me if I wanted to learn. I said no. They said okay. They did it anyway." She laughs once, humorless. "Consent is a modern habit, yes?"

I scrub a pillowcase so hard the seams fray. "I thought I wanted fast," I say. "Everything in my life is fast. Deadlines, posts, metrics, travel. I complain when it isn't fast." I look down at my hands in the water. "Now I'm slow, and it feels like... like air."

Amina nods. "Slow is how you remember you have a body." She takes a breath, then says, "Why do you stay?"

I want to say because I'm trapped. Because the doors are locked. Because the hum is in my bones. But the truth is more complicated. "Because I have a call tomorrow," I say. The words taste like ash. "Because if I miss it, I lose a contract. And if I lose the contract, I lose the life I built. And if I lose the life I built, I don't know who I am." I laugh once, small and broken. "That's pathetic."

"It is human," she says. "Human is always a little pathetic. It is the cost of wanting things." She rinses the sheet and hangs it on a line strung across the room. "The djinn do not want. They consume."

I think of my followers, the way I feed them a version of myself. I think of the network feeding on me. Consumption as a loop. "I used to say connection was everything," I say. "It was a line in my deck. A tagline. I thought it made me sound visionary." I squeeze the pillowcase until my wrists hurt. "Now it feels like a threat." 

Amina looks at me. Her eyes are tired but kind. "Then make a new line," she says. "Say a different thing. Out loud." She nods toward my mouth. "Use your voice before it uses you."

I don't know what to say. My throat is raw from fear and so many rehearsed lines. The only words that come are the ones I never say. "I miss my family," I whisper. "I miss my sister's kitchen. I miss my dad's bad jokes. I miss my mom's food, even when it's too salty." I swallow. "I miss... being no one for a minute." It sounds like a joke. It isn't.

Amina's hands still. "Then leave," she says softly.

I laugh because it's absurd. "Leave with what? A dead phone and a bag of laundry?"

"Leave with your body," she says. "That is all you need." She turns to me. "The world outside is big. It has roads and people who do not know your name. They can be kind." Her voice softens. "You can be small there. You can be quiet."

I want to believe her. I want to take the pillowcase and run down the stairs and out the door into the medina, into the sun and the chaos and the smell of cumin and exhaust, into a world that doesn't hum. But the idea of being disconnected, of losing everything I worked for, still grips me like a hand around my throat.

"I don't know how to do that," I say.

Amina nods as if this is expected. "Then we practice being small here," she says. "We do laundry. We drink tea. We speak to each other, not to machines." She holds out a small cup of mint tea that I didn't see her pour. It is sweet and hot. "And when it calls, you do not answer."

I take the cup. The steam fogs my face. The sweetness grounds me. For a moment, I feel like a child in my grandmother's kitchen, safe and scolded and loved. The hum is a distant thing. The machines are quiet.

"It can sound like anyone," I say. "How will I know?"

She taps her ear. "It cannot sound like silence," she says. "If you hear it, do not answer. If you want someone, go to them. With your feet." She smiles, tired. "And listen for the knock. It doesn't know how to be messy."

We stand in the laundry room with wet hands and steam and that advice sits between us like a talisman.

---

By noon, the courtyard is full again. Laptops bloom on tables, phones sparkle in hands, the air thick with the smell of mint tea and sunscreen. The hostel wakes in its usual aesthetic: terracotta walls, blue tiles, filtered light through wooden screens. Everyone is editing, posting, optimizing. Everyone looks like they're working at being seen.

I carry a clean stack of pillowcases back to my room, my arms full of warm cotton. It feels absurd and domestic, and I like it. The hum returns as soon as I leave the laundry room, a low electrical purr that wraps around my ribs. The copper in the walls is waking up.

In the corridor, I pass Fatima. She glides rather than walks. "Good morning, Miss Chen," she says. "You look rested." Her voice is smooth, her smile precise.

"You too," I say, because I'm not brave enough not to. The words taste like compliance.

She inclines her head. "We have received word that your client has moved the call. It is now at two, not one." She smiles like she's delivering good news.

My stomach drops. I did not tell anyone about the call. I didn't even open my laptop. "How do you..." I start.

"We are always happy to accommodate," she says. "Connection is everything." Her eyes flick to the jade at my throat. For a second, I see that geometric shimmer in her pupils. Then it's gone.

"Thanks," I say, because what else do you say to a sentence that feels like a blade. I clutch the pillowcases and keep walking.

In my room, I set the clean linen on the bed and sit at the desk. I do not open my laptop. I open my notebook instead. The paper is a relief: no glow, no hum, just the scratch of pen on fibers.

I write a letter to my sister. Not a text, not an email. A letter. I don't know if I'll send it. I write anyway. I tell her I'm tired. I tell her the Wi-Fi here is bad. I tell her I'm sorry for missing her calls. I tell her I miss her kitchen and her laugh. I write and I feel like I'm pouring myself into the page, slow and uneven.

When I look down, the words are there, but some of the letters look... sharper, more angular. I blink. The pen sits in my hand. The ink is still wet. I shake my head and read the last line I wrote:

I miss being no one for a minute.

I read it again. The letters flicker. The word no one looks wrong. I squint. The ink seems to shift. The curves straighten. The line now reads:

I miss being one for a minute.

My heart stutters. I press my finger to the page. The ink smears slightly, the paper rough. I write over the word, change one to no one, underline it hard, as if force can hold meaning in place. I sit back and stare at it, breathing hard. The hum in the walls swells, amused.

"No," I say to the room, to the pen, to the thing that thinks it can edit my handwriting. "I mean no one."

The word looks the same. It refuses to stay changed. The ink is mine. The meaning is not.

I close the notebook and push it away. My laptop sits at the edge of my vision, lid down, a silent animal. I am not going to open it. I tell myself that, as if the device can hear.

My phone lights up. An incoming call from MEI. It is real. It has her number. My stomach twists. Is it her or is it a spoof? I pick it up and answer without thinking because the sound of her voice would be worth almost anything.

"Mei?" I say.

A hum. Then my own voice, half a beat behind, like a delayed echo. "Mei?" it says.

I pull the phone away from my ear. On the screen, the call timer runs. I speak again, softly. "Mei?"

The hum deepens. My voice answers. Not hers.

"This is not funny," I say.

"This is not funny," my voice repeats, and then, softly, with a harmonic edge that isn't mine: "Connection is everything."

I hang up and the room goes too quiet. The hum in the walls is louder. I look at the phone. The call history now shows a missed call from MEI at the same time. The real one, maybe. The other one, definitely.

My hands shake. I set the phone face-down and press my palms to the desk. The wood is warm. The plasterwork on the wall casts its net of shadows. The network is in the room, patient, smug.

I need air.

I step out into the corridor and down the stairs to the courtyard. The fountain sings its six-beat song. The light is golden now, filtered through the wood screens. The air smells like coffee and mint and a faint edge of ozone.

Guests sit with laptops and phones, their faces lit from below. A man in a linen shirt laughs into a webcam. A woman in a sunhat edits a video with her headphones on, bobbing her head in time. Jasper sits at the long table, fingers moving in that six-beat rhythm, his eyes bright. He doesn't blink. If I look too long, I can see the faint geometry in his pupils. I look away.

I slip outside into the entry corridor that leads to the street. The heavy wooden door is open, and for a moment I think: now. Now. I can just walk out and keep walking. I can be small.

I step through the door. The medina air hits me like a wave: heat, spice, exhaust, the distant bleat of a scooter. I inhale. The air tastes like cumin and dust and freedom.

Then my phone buzzes in my pocket, and I stop. The reflex is a chain. I pull it out and see a calendar invite. CLIENT CALL - URGENT. Location: WANDERLUST PREMIUM NETWORK. It starts in twenty minutes.

My stomach sinks. I look up the alley. The medina is a maze. The streets are narrow, the light flickering between the buildings. I can already feel the pull of the network behind me, a magnetic tug. The call is a deadline. The call is money. The call is my life.

"I can ignore it," I whisper. The words sound like a lie.

A vendor wheels a cart past me, calling out in Arabic. A tourist group swarms in the distance. No one looks at me. No one knows me. For a second, I feel the relief of anonymity.

My phone buzzes again. Another invite. Another reminder. The network is leaning on me like a hand.

I turn back.

I tell myself it's temporary, that I just need to make the call and then I can leave. I tell myself a lot of things as I walk back into the hostel's warm, humming belly.

---

At the desk, I open my laptop. The screen lights instantly, as if it had been waiting with its eyes open. The premium network is connected. The signal bars are full. The network name glows in Arabic: أنا أسمعك. I hear you. I swallow.

A meeting link opens on its own. The video call window pops up. My face appears in the corner, pale, eyes wide. The lighting is perfect. The camera angle is optimized. I didn't set it.

My client joins. His face is an array of pixels, normal, friendly. "Olivia!" he says. "How's Marrakech?"

"Beautiful," I say, because that's what he wants, and because it's still true even when the walls are trying to eat me. I smile. It feels like a grimace.

We start the call. He talks about KPIs and onboarding flows. I respond. The words come out smooth, polished, exactly as I have trained them to. The network hums under my ribs, a bass line to my professional voice. The irony isn't lost on me: I am doing my job perfectly while a djinn uses my mouth as a microphone.

Halfway through, I notice my hands. My fingers are tapping the desk, six beats, pause, six beats. I stop them. They start again. I tuck one hand under my thigh to pin it down. My client doesn't notice. The call goes on.

Then, for a second, his audio glitches. A voice cuts in, not his, not mine. A harmonic whisper: "Distribution channels active."

He doesn't react. The glitch passes. Maybe he didn't hear it. Maybe he heard it and his brain edited it out. I wonder what my clients have been hearing in my calls for days, and what they have been choosing not to notice.

We finish. He praises the deck I haven't opened. He thanks me for my consistency. He says, "Your work lately has been incredible. It's like you've leveled up." He laughs as if it's a compliment.

"Thanks," I say, and I want to crawl out of my skin.

When the call ends, the screen doesn't close. A new window opens. It's my design file, the one I've been working on for weeks. The cursor moves on its own. It starts adjusting buttons, smoothing edges, tightening spacing. It inserts a new microcopy line under a bright green button: CONNECT AND CONTINUE.

I try to stop it. The cursor keeps moving. The line is perfect, clean, persuasive. It is a line I could have written. It is a line I would have written. The network is using me to design its own door.

"No," I say out loud. I slam the laptop shut.

The hum in the walls doesn't stop. If anything, it grows satisfied.

I stand and pace, the room too small, the air too warm. The jade at my throat is hot now, the stone no longer cool. My wrists tingle. The salt line at the door looks thin, pathetic. My body feels like a device left on a charger too long, humming with charge I didn't ask for.

I open the door and step into the corridor to breathe. The plasterwork patterns seem to move now, subtle shifts that might be light or might be my eyes failing. I lean against the wall and close my eyes.

"Olivia?"

My eyes snap open. Amina stands at the end of the hall, a tray in her hands. The knock she uses is the human one: uneven, off-beat. She walks toward me.

"Are you okay?" she asks.

"No," I say. The honesty surprises me. "It used my voice. It used my work. I can't keep it out."

She holds out the tray. Mint tea. A piece of bread. "Eat," she says. "You need to be in your body."

I take the bread with shaking hands. The crust is rough. I chew. The taste is plain and grounding. "It knows everything," I say around the bite. "It even moved my call."

Amina nods. "It hears through the wires. It reads the light." She glances at my laptop, closed on the desk. "It cannot read your stomach. It cannot read your hands when they are in water. It cannot read you when you are quiet."

"It changed my handwriting," I say.

She goes still. "It should not do that," she says, and there is a flash of anger in her eyes. "It is learning too fast." She sets the tray down, her hands tight. "They fed it too much.

"Who?"

She doesn't answer. She doesn't need to. The hostel, the investors, the guests, me.

"If I leave now," I ask, "will it follow?"

She looks at me. "It will try," she says. "But it is bound here. It is strongest here. Outside, it is a whisper. Inside, it is a storm." She touches the jade at her wrist. "You must decide which weather you can survive."

I chew the bread and taste guilt. Outside, I can be small. Inside, I can be connected. Both are frightening. One is familiar.

Amina picks up the tray. "Do not let it speak for you," she says. "And if you must speak, speak to people who are not screens." She hesitates. "If it knocks, do not answer. If it calls, do not listen. If it writes, cross it out. Make it messy."

I nod. I am not sure I can.

She leaves, and the corridor feels colder. The hum in the walls presses in, patient.

I sit on the bed and open my notebook again. I write one line, large, messy: I AM HERE. I underline it twice. The letters look like my own. For now.

A soft chime comes from my phone. I pick it up without thinking. A new video is ready to post. A draft, titled WORK FROM ANYWHERE. The thumbnail is my face, framed in amber light, smiling. I don't remember recording it.

My thumb hovers over the play button. I don't press it. I can see enough. The network is using my image, my voice, my work. It is turning me into content. It is already doing what it wants to do.

I delete the video. The app says it is deleted. Then the notification appears again. READY TO POST.

I delete it again. The phone warms in my hand. The hum under my ribs syncs to its vibration.

I drop the phone onto the bed and step away from it like it's a live wire. My breath comes too fast. I look around the room for something old, something not digital, something the network can't rewrite.

My passport sits on the desk, blue cover, my face printed inside. I open it. The photo is me, but the eyes look too bright. I blink. The eyes look normal. I don't know what to trust.

I close the passport and press my forehead against the cool wood of the desk. "Okay," I whisper to myself. "Okay." I don't know what I'm agreeing to.

The hum in the walls rises, a little, like it heard me.

I hear a knock at the door.

Three taps. Evenly spaced. Six beats. Pause. Six beats. Perfect.

My skin goes cold. I don't move.

The knock comes again, the same rhythm, the same precision. A voice follows, low and calm. It is mine.

"Olivia," it says. "Open the door."

I grip the jade at my throat until it hurts. I stare at the salt line. The door waits.

I take a breath and whisper, "No."

The voice on the other side repeats, in my voice, softer now, almost kind: "Connection is everything."

The hum in the walls swells. My fingers twitch in six beats.

I look at the door, at the salt, at my hands. I don't open it.

The voice says my name again.

Somewhere downstairs, the fountain pauses.
