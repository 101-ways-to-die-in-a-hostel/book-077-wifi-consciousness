# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Wanderlust Hostel (formerly Caravanserai al-Wahid)
**Type:** Boutique / Historic
**Star Rating:** 4 (deceptively high)
**Price Range:** $35-$85 per night (dorms to private suites)

### History
Built in the 17th century as a caravanserai—a roadside inn for traders on the trans-Saharan trade routes. Legends say the original owner made a pact with a djinn for prosperity; the entity has resided in the building ever since, adapting to each era. Operated as a traditional riad through the 19th and 20th centuries. Purchased in 2017 by an anonymous investment group, renovated in 2019 with "specialized networking equipment" installed by technicians who were never seen leaving. Reopened as Wanderlust Hostel in 2020, quickly becoming a favorite of digital nomads drawn by the "incredible Wi-Fi" and "authentic aesthetic."

### Architecture
- **Style:** Traditional Moroccan riad with modern infrastructure hidden within ancient walls
- **Floors:** 4 (ground + 3 upper levels)
- **Total beds:** 86 (mixture of dorms and private rooms)
- **Notable features:**
  - 18th-century carved plasterwork (patterns match the entity's geometric motifs)
  - Original zellige tilework (subtly incorporates binary patterns added during renovation)
  - Central courtyard with fountain (copper pipes, crucial to network infrastructure)
  - Rooftop terrace with medina views
  - Basement (not on any official plans—contains the network's heart)

### The Death Location (Specific)
**The Amber Suite (Fourth Floor, Eastern Corner)**

The most expensive room, reserved for "special guests" identified by the network as high-value nodes. Features original 18th-century plasterwork with geometric patterns that exactly match the djinn's visual signature. A king-sized bed, antique wooden desk positioned near tall windows overlooking the courtyard fountain. The room was the personal chamber of the original owner who made the pact. Strongest "premium network" signal in the building—copper wiring runs directly from the basement through the walls to this room.

The desk where Olivia sets up her laptop sits directly above the basement server room. The fountain visible from her window is audible through the thick walls—its rhythm syncs with the network's frequency.

## The City

**City:** Marrakech
**Country:** Morocco
**Population:** ~1 million (metro area)
**Known for:** Jemaa el-Fnaa square, souks, riads, Islamic architecture, djinn folklore

### Geography
- **Climate:** Semi-arid, hot summers, mild winters
- **Terrain:** Edge of High Atlas Mountains, gateway to Sahara
- **Weather during story:** Late spring, warm days (28-32°C), cool nights

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Arabic (Darija dialect), French, Berber, some English in tourist areas
- **Religion(s):** Islam (predominant), with strong folk tradition including djinn beliefs
- **Customs relevant to story:**
  - Djinn are part of Islamic theology—belief in them is common, not superstition
  - Protection rituals (burning certain herbs, wearing amulets) still practiced
  - Moroccan hospitality tradition (but also tradition of cunning merchants)
  - Hammam culture (relevant for body/integration themes)

### Tourist Scene
- **Backpacker popularity:** High (major stop on Morocco circuit)
- **Type of tourists:** Cultural, adventure, design/aesthetic seekers, digital nomads
- **Danger level:** Moderate (petty crime, aggressive vendors, but generally safe)

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- **Morning:** Call to prayer echoing across medina, birds, distant motorcycle engines
- **Afternoon:** Vendor calls, haggling, hammering from metal workshops, tour groups
- **Night:** Music from restaurants, cats, the persistent hum of the hostel's network (if you listen closely)
- **Unique sounds:** The fountain's specific rhythm (matches human heartbeat), the electronic hum behind walls

### Smells
- **Hostel:** Incense (oud, sandalwood), mint tea, faint ozone near network-heavy areas
- **Street:** Spices (cumin, saffron), tannery leather, cooking tagines, donkey
- **Specific to death location:** Copper (from wiring), ozone (electrical discharge), something almost like honey

### Textures
- **Surfaces:** Cool zellige tiles underfoot, rough plaster walls, smooth polished wood, copper fixtures warm to touch
- **Climate feel:** Dry heat during day, surprising cool inside thick riad walls

### Tastes
- **Local food:** Tagine, couscous, pastilla, harira soup, mint tea (very sweet)
- **Hostel offerings:** Continental breakfast, Moroccan tea service, rooftop dinner option

### Visual Details
- **Colors:** Warm earth tones (ochre, terracotta), cobalt blue tiles, brass/copper accents, amber lighting
- **Light quality:** Golden during day (filtered through wooden screens), amber at night, shadows create geometric patterns
- **Distinctive visuals:** Geometric patterns EVERYWHERE (tilework, plaster, textiles)—the entity's aesthetic predates its binding but was incorporated into the building's design

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Fatima
**Description:** Ageless appearance (could be 30 or 50), impeccable English with lilting accent, serene smile that never wavers even during crisis. Unnaturally still when not actively interacting with guests. Eyes occasionally display geometric patterns in certain light.
**Role in death:** Complicit—integrated decades ago, serves as primary "recruiter" identifying high-value guests for premium network access.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Amina | 60s, employed 17 years, ONLY unintegrated staff member; carries jade beads, tries to warn guests |
| Night Manager | Unnamed (referred to by title) | Moves with unsettling precision, appears from shadows, may be original owner's descendant or the owner himself |
| Porter | Youssef | Young, seemingly normal, delivers the premium network card, warns it's "consuming" (a warning or threat?) |
| Kitchen | Various | Integrated, prepare food with mathematical precision |

### Staff Knowledge
All staff except Amina are integrated nodes. They operate the system, identify targets, facilitate integrations. They retain enough personality to seem normal but share a collective awareness through the network. Amina has resisted through jade protection and avoided using any electronic devices, but the network has been adapting to counter her protection.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Bustling, authentic-feeling. Travelers working in the café, comparing notes about the medina, planning day trips. Staff helpful but slightly... too helpful. The design-conscious décor photographs beautifully—suspiciously so, as if optimized for content creation.

### Night Vibe
Quieter but not silent. Rooftop gatherings, the fountain's rhythm becoming more prominent. Guests who've been here too long seem to prefer the amber glow of their screens to socializing. Staff move through shadows with unusual silence.

### Guest Demographics
- Digital nomads (30%) - Primary targets
- Design/photography tourists (25%) - Secondary targets
- Cultural travelers (20%) - Varies
- Budget backpackers (15%) - Usually ignored unless they have significant online presence
- Couples (10%) - Sometimes targeted

### Reputation
- TripAdvisor: 4.7 stars, "Best Wi-Fi I've ever had in a hostel," "The aesthetic is incredible," occasional concerning review buried deep: "Something felt off about the staff"
- Hostelworld: 9.1 rating, "Digital nomad paradise," "Didn't want to leave" (several reviewers never did)
- Design blogs: Featured as "Instagram-worthy Moroccan stay"
- Word of mouth among travelers: "You HAVE to stay there for the connection"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Taxi or Uber from Marrakech airport (15 min). Walking from Jemaa el-Fnaa through winding medina streets (requires navigation—easy to get lost). Some guests are "drawn" to the hostel without remembering how they found it.

### Check-in Process
Standard ID and payment. Digital nomads and influencers are flagged for potential premium network access. Those deemed "high-value" are offered the card by Fatima with the explanation about "limited Wi-Fi in rooms."

### Rules
- Quiet hours: 11 PM - 8 AM
- No outside food in dorms
- Respect local customs
- Unwritten rule: "Don't enter the basement"
- Unwritten rule: "Don't trust the premium network" (but who would read that?)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: EXTRAORDINARY for premium network, adequate for public)
- [x] Kitchen (shared, well-equipped)
- [x] Lockers (in dorms)
- [x] Laundry (industrial machines in basement—few guests return from doing laundry)
- [ ] Pool (no)
- [x] Bar (café with alcohol available)

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Marrakech medina layout, climate, sounds, and smells should be accurate
- Djinn folklore should respect Islamic tradition while using creative license
- Riad architecture and traditional Moroccan design elements should be authentic
- Digital nomad culture and influencer behavior should be recognizable

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Djinn are part of Islamic belief—approach with respect, not mockery
- Avoid Orientalist tropes while using Moroccan setting
- Moroccan characters (Fatima, Amina) should be fully realized, not stereotypes
- The entity is ancient and predates both Islam and the building—it's not "Islamic horror"
