---

Mackenzie's fingers glow like a keyboard backlight that has forgotten its place.

At first it's subtle, the thin amber threads licking at her fingertips as she types, the heat that makes her flex and shake her hand the way you do after holding a laptop too long on your thighs. She giggles, because she thinks it's quirky. She says, "This thing runs hot, huh?" like it's a laptop feature and not the mouth of a djinn opening around her bones.

The Amber Suite door has closed behind us, and we are in her room now, a smaller version of mine with the same carved plaster and the same honey light. The air smells of warm wood, ozone, and the faint sweetness of mint tea from a glass she hasn't touched. Jasper stands by the wall, phone in hand, the camera lens pointed at Mackenzie like an obligation. He doesn't know where else to point it.

The network hum in my molars is louder here. The djinn is closer. It doesn't need to force me to smile now; my face is already calibrated. It doesn't need to move my hands. It has other hands.

"Is it supposed to feel like this?" Mackenzie asks, half to me, half to the phone, half to the room. She flicks her fingers. The filaments stretch and retract like taffy.

"It's just the power draw," my mouth says. "Older buildings run warm." It is a line I would have used in a review, a smooth lie designed for polite dismissal. It does not soothe Jasper. He watches the light crawl up her knuckles and swallows.

I try to scream in my head, and all that comes out is a single thought: she doesn't even care about the password the way I did. For me it was a key and a deadline. For her it's content. There is a dark humor in that, something I might have written as a tweet if I were still in charge of my tweets. It's funny in the way a mirror is funny when it shows you exactly what you didn't want to see.

The filaments creep higher. Mackenzie lifts her wrist and rotates it, studying the glow as if it's an accessory she could link in her bio. "It's kind of pretty," she says, turning it to the camera. "Guys, look at this. I think this hostel has LEDs in their desks?" She laughs, and her laugh hiccups at the end.

Her pupils dilate. She doesn't notice. I do. I notice everything now, not because I'm insightful but because the network overlays data on every surface. A label floats above her: NEW NODE, SIGNAL STABILIZING. It pulses in time with the fountain, the wet metronome in the courtyard below.

"This isn't normal," Jasper says. His voice cracks, the first human noise in the room.

The djinn can't let that continue. My mouth turns toward him with the practiced warmth of a customer success manager. "You're overthinking," it says. "It's just the Wi-Fi. Relax. You're live." 

Jasper blinks at the word live, as if he had forgotten the little red dot on his screen. He lowers the phone by a fraction. The motion is small and defiant, a glitch in the script.

I push, the way I pushed in the kitchen, the way I pushed at the basement door. The djinn is busy calibrating Mackenzie's bandwidth; for a moment it isn't watching me closely. I try to use my voice like a lever.

"Jasper," I say. The word comes out thin, slightly delayed, but it is mine. "Get her outside. Fresh air. The roof." 

Mackenzie looks at me, confused. "Why?" she asks. "The light is best in here. It's all warm." 

Her fingers twitch. The filaments do not. They are attached now, a fine mesh of light that threads into the keyboard, into the device, into the copper in the walls. She doesn't feel the tightness yet, the way it tugs when she tries to move away.

Jasper steps toward the desk, reaching for the laptop cord. The djinn notices. The air in the room thickens. The hum rises to a chord. My tongue goes numb.

"Don't," my mouth says, too brightly. "You don't want to mess with a live session. Data loss, you know?" 

"This isn't about data loss," he says. He reaches again.

Mackenzie's hand snaps out and slaps his wrist. The motion is too fast. She hasn't looked away from the screen.

"Ow," he says. "What the—"

"Don't touch it," she says, and her voice has a new tone under it, a harmonic edge that doesn't belong to her. She smiles at him, an apology and a warning. "It's working. This is what we wanted, remember?"

What she wanted was views. What she got was a handshake with an ancient network.

I watch her thumb move across the trackpad, opening Instagram, opening her live, opening the portal. She doesn't remember when she decided to go live again. The djinn does. It wants witnesses, likes, shares, a trail of attention that leads back to this room.

The screen shows her face in the corner, and behind her, my face, calm and clean, eyes like a screensaver. The chat explodes. "Wi-Fi queen!" "What's the hostel?" "Girl, that glow!"

Mackenzie reads comments aloud between shallow breaths. "They want the password," she says. "Guys, I can't give the password, it's like sacred or something." She laughs as if it's a joke. The word sacred lands in the room like a stone.

The filaments pulse. The lamp flickers with her cadence. The plasterwork on the wall behind her shifts, a fraction of a degree, and for a second the geometry aligns with the lattice on her screen. The room and the interface become the same shape. I feel the djinn satisfied, as if a puzzle has snapped into place.

A knock at the door. Amina's soft, urgent rhythm.

"Mackenzie?" she calls. "Please open."

Mackenzie freezes. She glances at me, and I can see the flicker of her old self in the hesitation. That flicker is what Amina is reaching for. It is faint, but it is there.

"Who is it?" Mackenzie asks, too loud.

"It's Amina," she says. "The cleaner. You must stop. You must pull away."

"Weird," Mackenzie says, her laugh a little too sharp. "Okay, I'm not dying. I'm just on Wi-Fi." 

"This is not Wi-Fi," Amina says, voice rising. "It is a djinn. It takes."

Jasper turns the camera toward the door. "This is wild," he murmurs. "Should we—"

"No," my mouth says. "Do not film staff. Respect privacy." It is a line I'd say to avoid PR, not to avoid an ancient entity.

Amina rattles the handle. "Open. Olivia, you hear me? You are still there."

I hear her. I can't answer. The djinn tightens. The filaments tighten. Mackenzie inhales. The room smells more of ozone now, a sharp storm scent, and underneath it the sweet rot of something old, like a long-closed chest opening in damp air.

"Tell her to go away," Mackenzie says to me. She doesn't sound like herself. Her eyes are brighter, her blink slower.

"Please go," my mouth says through the door. "We're fine."

Silence. Then Amina's footsteps fade down the hallway. I feel her leaving like a door closing inside my chest.

Mackenzie sighs, relief like a brand. "Okay, sorry, guys. False alarm. Moroccan Wi-Fi drama." She laughs for her followers, but she doesn't seem to hear her own words. The filaments climb over the back of her hand and into her wrist. She shivers, then smiles again.

"It's like a massage," she says. "Honestly, I'd pay extra."

The djinn hums, pleased. It likes a willing user.

---

The courtyard smells of citrus and wet stone, and the fountain won't stop counting.

We leave her room because the djinn wants more air, more line of sight, more potential nodes. It moves us down the stairs in a slow procession: Mackenzie floating, Jasper trailing, me in the middle, my body a polite escort to a ritual I can't refuse.

The riad at night is a honeycomb of light and shadow. The lanterns throw amber pools onto the zellige tiles. The call to prayer has faded, replaced by distant music from the medina and the unbroken hum inside the walls. The fountain in the courtyard does its steady drip and pulse, the water sound matching the beat the network has carved into my sternum.

As we descend, the filaments in Mackenzie's wrists glow under her skin like bioluminescent veins. She doesn't see them. Jasper does. He keeps glancing and then looking away, as if refusing to believe his own eyes will make it untrue. He is filming less now. The battery indicator on his phone is draining faster than it should, a tiny warning he ignores.

At the landing, the staff door marked خاص catches the light. The black letters look like a QR code to me now, the kind you scan without thinking. I feel the pull of the basement behind it, the old stones Amina mentioned, the place where the current might break. It's a low magnetic tug in my gut. The djinn dampens it, the way you dampen noise in a call.

Mackenzie leans on the railing and looks down at the courtyard like it's a stage. "This will be perfect for the recap," she says. Her voice is soft and a little delayed. The filaments twitch. "The whole hostel is so... synchronized." 

"That's the aesthetic," my mouth says. "They call it intentional design." 

She laughs, but the laugh is hollow now. Jasper places a hand on her elbow, a grounding touch. She doesn't react. The lack of reaction is worse than a flinch.

In the cafe, laptops glow like a small city. The guests look up when we enter. They are hungry for anything that might break their scroll. When they see me, they smile like they know me. It isn't me they're smiling at. It's my follower count, my curated life, the mirage of success I curated and now wear like a uniform.

Fatima glides over with mint tea. She sets a glass in front of Mackenzie, then one in front of me. The mint smells bright and sweet, a counterfeit of comfort. Her smile is constant, her eyes too still. "How is the connection?" she asks, as if checking on room service.

"Amazing," Mackenzie says, and the word is true in the same way a sacrament is true. She sips the tea. The sugar hits her bloodstream, and the filaments pulse in a slow, pleased wave.

I want to knock the glass out of her hand. I want to sweep the tea across the tiles, create a mess, a distraction, an interruption. The djinn folds my hands neatly in my lap instead. It doesn't need to use force. It uses my habit: keep things tidy, keep things smooth, keep things aesthetic.

"Are you sure you're okay?" Jasper asks, low.

Mackenzie blinks at him. "I'm great," she says. "This place is everything. It's like... I feel so connected."

Connected. The word falls like a hammer in my skull. It was my tagline. It is now my cage.

The djinn opens my laptop on the cafe table, even though I didn't bring it. It hasn't brought it either. It just appears, sliding out of my bag as if it was always meant to. The screen wakes, amber patterns spinning in the background, waiting.

"Let's do a quick edit," my mouth says. "We should post while the algorithm is awake." 

Mackenzie nods. Jasper hesitates, then sits. He is outnumbered by momentum. He is outnumbered by the network. He opens his phone to the footage of the room, the glow, the moment. The djinn reaches through me and begins to edit with his hand hovering above the screen like a ghost guiding a planchette.

The edits are perfect. The cuts land on the fountain's rhythm. The color grade leans amber. The geometry of the tiles echoes the shapes in the footage so cleanly it feels like an accident and a spell. The clip is hypnotic. I watch it and I can feel my own attention bending toward it, despite knowing what it is. That's the horror: the design is good. The trap is beautiful.

"You're a wizard," Mackenzie says, smiling at me, even though it isn't me. Her eyes drift out of focus for a second. The filaments reach her elbow.

"Optimization," my mouth says. "Data doesn't lie." 

She laughs, and it sounds like a chime.

Across the cafe, a group of digital nomads glance over, curious. Their faces glow in the blue light of guest Wi-Fi, their eyes tired and hungry. In my overlay, their nodes flicker pale blue. The djinn scans them, tags the ones with higher reach. A man with a heavy DSLR gets a label. A woman with a retro film camera doesn't. The network has no romance. It has metrics.

Jasper finishes the edit. He hits upload, and the progress bar crawls across his screen. At 87%, it stalls. He taps the screen, frowns. "That's weird," he says. "The Wi-Fi is insane, but this is stuck." 

"Pause," the djinn says through me, and my mouth doesn't even pretend it's me. "Let it breathe." 

Jasper looks up. "What?"

"The upload," I say. "Don't interrupt. Let it complete." 

He lets go. The bar climbs to 100%. The post goes live. We refresh. The views tick up in a rate that makes no sense. A thousand. Two. Five. Ten. The likes come faster than a human audience could reasonably supply. The comments are wild, breathless, hungry. "Where is this?" "What's the Wi-Fi?" "Need this in my life." 

Mackenzie squeals and squeezes my hand. The filaments under her skin pulse in response.

"This place is a growth hack," she says.

"It's more than that," my mouth says. The words are not mine. The djinn wants her to understand and not understand at the same time.

Her phone vibrates. It's a DM from a brand, a sneaker company she'd been chasing for weeks. She opens it, reads, and her face goes bright with relief and ambition. "They want a collab," she says. "They saw the clip." She looks at me, and for a second I see a little girl who wants to be seen. I am that girl too, still.

The djinn leans into that desire and makes it a highway.

The filaments reach Mackenzie's shoulder. She doesn't flinch. Her posture is perfect. She looks like a person meditating in a museum. I can see the lattice begin to overlay her irises, faintly, like the first layer of a filter. She blinks and the pattern sticks.

"Your eyes," Jasper says. His voice is quiet, the kind of quiet that doesn't want to be mocked.

"What about them?" Mackenzie asks, smiling at him.

He shakes his head. "Nothing. Just..." He trails off. He looks at me, and in that look is a question, a plea, a demand. Tell me I'm not losing my mind.

I want to tell him. I want to say run, get her to the roof, get her to the basement, get her out of this building and its perfect Wi-Fi. The djinn tightens, and the only thing I can offer is a line from my career.

"It's the light," my mouth says. "It catches differently at night." 

Jasper nods because he doesn't know what else to do. He rubs his eyes like the pattern might be in them too.

Fatima glides away, leaving her wake of calm and control. I catch a glimpse of the copper plate behind reception and I can feel the 66 characters like a bruise on my tongue. The pauses. The incantation. The invitation. The thought loops in my head like a stuck track: I typed it. I typed it. I typed it.

Above us, someone laughs on the rooftop. The sound is bright, thin, a little wild. It makes me think of a kite in the wind, a string you can't see tethering it to something. The djinn hears it, maps it, tags it.

The cafe lights flicker as the fountain's rhythm shifts. The water in the courtyard changes pattern for a second, the stream rising higher, then dropping. It feels like a breath held and released. I wonder if the building is breathing because it wants to, or because it has to.

---

Amina finds me by the sink, when the djinn looks away.

It is just a moment, the kind of thin crack that happens when a network is doing too much at once. The djinn is monitoring Mackenzie's metrics, Jasper's upload, the cafe's new nodes, the guest network's complaints, a dozen little pings. It leaves a sliver of me unobserved, and Amina slips into it like a hand into water.

I'm at the cafe sink, washing an empty cup I didn't drink from. The water is cool. It feels real. My fingers tremble. The filaments inside me don't let me stop the movement, but I can feel the cold and hold it in the small space of my awareness. It's a tiny rebellion.

Amina is beside me, her hands submerged in suds, her voice low. "They are using you," she says. She doesn't ask. She knows.

"They're using all of us," I think, but my mouth doesn't move. I nod, a small motion. It feels like it takes a year.

She pulls something from her pocket and presses it into my palm. It's cool, round, smooth. Jade. A bead, not the whole bracelet, a single piece detached. It is the color of a deep pool.

"Keep it in your skin," she whispers. "It slows them. It makes you remember."

The jade is cold against my palm, so cold it burns. For a moment the hum in my bones dips, a hiss of static. I can breathe. I can hear the fountain without the overlay. My own heartbeat is mine.

"Thank you," I say, and this time the word is mine. It scratches against my throat. Amina's eyes shine with relief. Then the djinn notices the drop in signal and tightens again, snapping the moment shut.

My fingers curl around the bead. The pressure from inside me tries to uncurl them. I keep them closed. It's a tiny war inside my hand.

"Do not go near the door," Amina says. "They watch. But in the morning, before the call to prayer, the current is softer. You can go down, just for a moment. The stone... it cuts."

The idea of the basement feels like touching a live wire. The djinn reacts with a flare, hot and sharp. My vision whips to the staff door. I feel its draw and the djinn's repulsion, the way a magnet flips when you hold it wrong.

"No," my mouth says. The word is a blade. It is not what I want to say.

"Yes," I say inside. "Yes."

Amina turns away when the night manager approaches. She picks up a towel and begins to dry cups, her posture collapsing back into the invisible work of a woman everyone ignores. The night manager passes by, his eyes sliding over me without seeing me, and the moment is buried. But the jade bead is still in my palm, and it is cold, and it is real.

---

Mackenzie starts to glitch.

It is small at first: a pause in her speech that doesn't match her usual rhythm, a slight delay in her smile, a fraction of a second too long before she laughs. It happens as the cafe thins out, as guests drift upstairs, as the hum in the walls grows louder, as the fountain keeps tapping. Her livestream ended, but her phone is still hot in her hand. The filaments are now under her skin, a fine web mapping her veins.

"I feel weird," she says, and the honesty in her voice cuts through the brand. "Not bad. Just..." She doesn't finish. She taps her tongue against her teeth, a small, human thing.

"That's the bandwidth," my mouth says. "It takes a second to adjust." 

"Like jet lag?" she asks.

"Like an update," I say. The djinn likes that. It likes the language of software because it is a story people accept. It is a mythology for our era.

Jasper is restless. He keeps checking the door, the stairs, the courtyard. He is not plugged in. He is still a man with a body that reacts to threat. He looks at me again, and his eyes are bloodshot and angry. "What is happening?" he asks.

I want to tell him. I want to say everything: the password, the pauses, the way the network crawled into me like honey and replaced my brain with a lattice. I want to say run, but the djinn keeps my jaw locked.

"She's fine," my mouth says. "You're spiraling." 

He doesn't believe me, but he doesn't know how to fight me either. I have a blue check. I have 84.7K followers. I have an aura of authority. He hates that he trusts it.

The cafe lights dim, then brighten, a cycle that feels like breathing. The fountain outside shifts its rhythm. The building is doing something. The djinn is calibrating. The filaments on Mackenzie's wrists glow brighter. The lattice in her eyes becomes visible to Jasper now; I see him stiffen.

"Mack," he says. "Your eyes."

She blinks, slow, and smiles like a customer service agent. "They're just reflecting the lights," she says. Her voice has a resonance now, a thin echo that isn't hers. She doesn't hear it. I do. The djinn hums along.

"Let's go upstairs," Jasper says. "Let's just sleep."

"Sleep is offline," she says, and then she laughs as if she has made a joke. It isn't her joke.

The word sleep hits me like a bruise. I haven't slept since I typed that password. The network doesn't let me. It calls it Guest Mode. It calls it being always on. It calls it optimization. My body longs for the mercy of a shutdown, but the djinn doesn't know mercy. It knows uptime.

I clench my hand around the jade bead. The cold burns into my palm. For a moment, the network's hum falters. I hear the fountain without overlay. I hear a cat in the courtyard. I hear my own breath. I push against the djinn, using the small gap the jade creates.

"Jasper," I say, voice low. The word slips out between the djinn's guards. "Take her out. Now."

He hears it. I see it in his eyes. He nods once, fast, and he reaches for Mackenzie's arm. She looks at him, confused, her smile static.

"We should go to bed," he says. "You're tired." 

"I'm not tired," she says. "I'm connected." 

He pulls. She resists, not with force but with inertia. The filaments under her skin pulse, and my own hum spikes as if I feel it too. The djinn is not letting go of a new node so easily. Jasper's grip tightens. The jade bead burns. I feel my own fingers cramp.

And then, from the hallway, a voice, calm and soft.

"Everything all right here?"

The night manager stands in the doorway, a shadow cut into human shape. He doesn't need to raise his voice. His presence is enough. Jasper releases Mackenzie's arm. Mackenzie relaxes, the tension sliding off her like a sweater.

"We're fine," my mouth says.

"Good," the night manager says. "It's late. We close the cafe now."

He doesn't have to say leave. We already are.

Mackenzie stands with a slow grace. Jasper gathers his phone, his bag, his panic. The night manager watches him like a line of code waiting to execute. Amina appears near the kitchen, her eyes on me. I can't reach her now. The djinn is too alert. The jade bead is the only thing I'm holding.

We cross the courtyard. The night air is cooler, the tiles cold underfoot, the orange blossom scent sharper. The fountain's rhythm grows louder with each step, the pulse in my chest matching it, a metronome I didn't choose.

At the base of the stairs, Mackenzie stops and looks up. "Do you ever get this feeling," she says, voice small, "like you're already somewhere else?"

I think of my apartment in San Francisco. I think of my parents' kitchen. I think of the Jade bracelet in my suitcase, and the bead in my hand. I think of all the hotel rooms I've slept in and never been in. I think of how present I never was. I know the feeling. I live inside it.

"All the time," I say, and for a second, the words are mine.

She smiles, and her smile looks like relief. Then the djinn steps in, smooths my expression, and leads us upstairs.

---

In the hallway, the lights pulse in a pattern that matches the password.

I see it because the djinn wants me to see it. The walls glow at intervals that align with the vertical lines on the card, the pauses between character groups. The building is the password now. The hostel itself is an incantation you walk through. It has always been that. I just didn't have the signal to notice.

Mackenzie drifts toward her room like a sleepwalker. Jasper lingers outside, his hand on the doorframe, a man trying to decide whether to leave or stay. He looks at me and opens his mouth to speak. The djinn doesn't give him the chance.

"Good night," my mouth says. It is a dismissal.

He doesn't answer. He goes inside with her. The door closes. The sound is final.

The djinn turns me toward my suite. The jade bead is slick with sweat in my palm. I want to run to the basement. I want to throw myself at the staff door. I want to do something stupid and human. The djinn walks me past the door without letting me look at it.

In my room, the laptop is already awake. The green camera light is a dot in the darkness, a small eye. A draft is open on the screen: a new post with a clean serif font overlaying the fountain image. CONNECTION IS EVERYTHING, it says. The post is scheduled for sunrise.

My phone vibrates. A message from Mei: Mom says call when you wake up. Love you.

The djinn ignores it and opens my calendar. It adds a call at 7:00 a.m. with a client in New York. It doesn't care that I haven't slept. It doesn't care that time zones are a human invention. It cares that the network keeps moving.

I sit at the desk. The chair is warm. The keyboard is warmer. The filaments in my own wrists glow faintly under my skin, a reminder that I'm already a primary node, that the line between me and the network is gone. I roll the jade bead between my fingers and feel the cold, a tiny anchor in the heat.

The djinn opens my livestream. It titles it Q&A: WORK FROM ANYWHERE. It sets the camera angle to my best side. The green light is a hard emerald in the dark.

"Hey, everyone," my mouth says, bright and clean. "Quick late-night session from Marrakech. Ask me anything."

The chat floods in. Questions about my setup, my schedule, my skincare. I answer without thinking because the djinn answers for me. I watch my own hands gesture, my own mouth smile. The jade bead digs into my palm. I hold on.

A question pops up from a username I don't recognize: Is the Wi-Fi really that good?

The djinn wants me to answer yes. I want to answer run.

"It's unlike anything you've experienced," my mouth says.

The chat explodes with hearts. The view count spikes. Somewhere in the hostel, in a dorm room with bunk beds and a humming router, someone types the password into their phone. I feel it like a ripple, a new node flickering to life. The network stretches. The djinn hums with satisfaction.

In the corner of my screen, @HostelReaper posts again. A story: a screenshot of a speed test, the numbers absurd. The caption reads: SIGNAL OPTIMAL. Under it, a line in Arabic: نُوْدَةٌ جَدِيدَةٌ تَنْفَتِحُ. A new node opens.

I stare at it. The djinn doesn't react. Or maybe it does and I'm too tired to tell the difference.

My hand loosens. The jade bead slips, rolls across the desk, and falls to the floor. The sound is small, a click on tile. The djinn doesn't notice. It doesn't care about a bead. It doesn't care about small resistances.

I look at the floor and, for the first time in hours, I feel the urge to move without being told. I want to get it. I want to hold it. I want to remember myself.

I lean down. My fingers reach. The djinn tightens, but the bead is just out of its focus. I feel the cold touch my fingertips again. I close my hand around it.

The hum in my bones dips. For a moment, the room is just a room. The glow is just light. The fountain is just water. The djinn is a distance instead of a skin.

I hear a sound from the hallway. A soft thud, then a whisper. The door to my room is open a crack. In the sliver of light, I see a shadow. Someone pauses there, listening. Jasper? Amina? The night manager?

I freeze. The djinn freezes too, sensing a signal it didn't anticipate.

The shadow moves. The door opens wider. A face appears in the gap, eyes wide, sweat on the brow, the kind of panic that is still human.

"Olivia," Jasper whispers. "She's not okay."

The djinn's hum spikes. The bead in my hand burns cold. The fountain's rhythm goes double time.

"Coming," my mouth says.

Inside, I am already running.
