**Part:** 1 (Setup)
**Word Count:** ~4,050
**POV:** Olivia Chen
**Location:** Wanderlust Hostel, Marrakech - Mackenzie's Room/Staff Corridor/Basement Stairs/Amber Suite
**Timeline:** Day 2, Pre-Dawn to Sunrise

---

At 4:58 a.m., the Wi-Fi blinks.

It is the smallest of glitches, a hiccup in a network that has been relentless. The amber glow in Mackenzie's room dims, then returns. The hum in my molars drops half a note. The fountain's pulse stutters and catches. The building exhales, as if the night has been a held breath and the coming dawn finally lets it go.

The djinn stiffens in me. It doesn't like the dip, the little blind spot in its vision. It has been a smooth stream all night, and now there is a buffer. Now there is latency.

My own mind takes that pause and tries to run.

Mackenzie is still live. The green camera light is a hard emerald, the chat a waterfall I can see reflected in her eyes. The password card sits on the desk like an offering. She keeps pointing to it, a slow, hypnotic motion, as if she is teaching a prayer to a congregation that wants to believe.

"Pause at the lines," she says, smiling. "It's like a ritual. It's kind of beautiful." 

The chat is a chorus of skull emojis and heart emojis. Half of them are joking. Half of them are already typing. I feel each keystroke as a prick in my wrists, tiny pings from outside the hostel, the network stretching out into the world. The djinn is building a map, and every new node is a bright point on it. The map used to be just this building. Now it is the internet.

The glitch at 4:58 a.m. feels like a door. I want to walk through it.

I push, and a word slips out of my mouth without the djinn smoothing it first.

"Mackenzie," I say, low.

She turns, the lattice in her eyes rotating. "Hm?"

"Turn it off. Just for a minute. Your battery needs a break." 

It's a pitch she can understand. It is the only language I have left.

She laughs, a light sound that doesn't belong to her. "This is the best engagement I've ever had. I can't waste it. The algorithm is awake." 

The sentence is mine, too. The djinn uses my habits the way it uses my bones.

The blink comes again, weaker, a second hiccup. The hum falls. I can hear the actual dawn outside, the early birds in the courtyard, the faint rustle of leaves on the roof. A thin line of pale light slides under the curtain like a text notification.

The djinn doesn't like daylight. It has lived in smoke and flame, in ink and trade routes, in copper and current. The sun is old, older than its binding, and it makes the network's edges fray. I can feel it. That is my opening.

Amina said before dawn. The current is softer. The stone cuts.

I swallow the thought and turn my body toward the door. The djinn notices the shift in intention and tightens, but the light is already changing the room's algorithm. There is lag. It can't lock me fast enough.

"I need water," my mouth says, and for once it isn't a lie. My throat is dry, metallic, a wire left out in the sun.

Mackenzie nods without looking away from the camera. "Hydrate, queen," she says, and the chat cheers. The djinn lets me go because it thinks it knows where I am going. It thinks I am a peripheral errand it can route around.

I step into the hallway.

The light at the end of the corridor is no longer amber. It is soft and gray, the color of the sky before sunrise. The carved plaster looks less like a circuit and more like a pattern again, ancient and beautiful but not yet alive. The hum in the walls is quieter, like a server room after hours. I can breathe without the network telling me my breath is a waveform.

Somewhere down the hall, a door opens and closes. A guest pads past in socks, hair crushed by sleep, carrying a water bottle like a child clutching a toy. He yawns, squints at me, and nods the way backpackers nod at each other in corridors at 5 a.m., a shared agreement to pretend this is normal. He doesn't see the lattice in my eyes. He doesn't see the way the light reacts when I move. I am still just a woman in linen, a stranger with a laptop problem.

The hostel is in its in-between state, neither night nor day. The rooftop furniture is stacked, the cafe chairs upside down on tables, the breakfast trays arranged but not yet served. The smell of bread warms the air behind the kitchen door, yeast and sesame and heat, a smell that would have made me hunger once. Now it makes me ache for ordinary.

I walk fast. The tile is cool against my bare feet, grounding and ordinary. A knot in my chest loosens. I follow the corridor toward the staff door, the one marked KHAS, the private threshold that has been a firewall all night.

Amina is there, as if she has been waiting in the dim with the patience of someone who knows time is a thing you can bend.

Her face is lined with exhaustion, her hair pulled back, her hands still wet from cleaning. The jade bead is wrapped in a corner of her cloth. She sees me and nods once. No questions. No speeches. Just a decision.

"Now," she whispers.

She presses the jade bead into my palm. Cold floods my skin. The hum in my bones dips like a wave. It hurts in a sharp, clean way, like the first breath after being underwater too long.

"The stone is below," she says. "You must touch it. It will remember you." 

"Will it hurt?" I ask.

"Yes," she says, and then, because she is honest in a way the djinn never is, she adds, "But it is your pain."

We move together, quick and quiet. The staff corridor smells of citrus cleaner and damp, a human smell. The sign on the door that says STAFF ONLY is a typography choice I would have applauded once. Now it is a barricade.

Amina takes a key from beneath her apron. It is old brass, not a swipe card. She slides it into the lock and turns. The click is small and absolute.

The door opens.

The air beyond is colder, wetter. Stone breath. The staircase down is narrow, the kind of steps built before hotel codes required railings. The walls are bare, no plasterwork, no amber lamps. The hum is thinner here. The network doesn't like this place. That is why it is still stone and not copper.

I take one step. Two. The temperature drops. Moisture beads on my skin. The jade bead in my palm feels less like a burn and more like a balm.

I am halfway down when the djinn realizes.

The pressure hits behind my eyes, a sudden bright ache. My teeth buzz. My knees buckle. The hum rises, then skews into a high frequency that makes my stomach lurch. The djinn is a current in copper; it hates stone. It hates not being the loudest thing in the room.

"Olivia," Amina says behind me, urgent. "Keep moving." 

I try. My legs are heavy. The djinn pulls upward; the stone pulls downward. I am a point between two magnets.

The stairwell opens into a low corridor. The light is dim, not from bulbs but from the faint glow of cables running along the walls. Copper veins, thick and warm. Old stone meets new wiring, like a scar. The air smells of damp earth and ozone, of old water and new electricity.

To my left, a heavy wooden door stands ajar. Through the gap I glimpse a room lined with copper plates, their edges hammered into the stone. The floor is a mosaic of old tiles, geometric patterns that match the ones upstairs but feel less decorative, more intentional. An etched circle sits at the center, a ring of Arabic script that I cannot read, a place where something once burned. It doesn't glow. It doesn't need to. It feels like a mouth that is closed but still breathing.

To my right, the corridor opens into the old cistern. The air is colder there, the kind of cold that tastes metallic. Rows of server racks hum under a thin layer of condensation, their LEDs a cluster of tiny eyes. Cables spill across the floor like roots. In a corner, someone has painted a phrase in black: ANA ASMA'UK. I hear you. The letters look fresh, as if they were written yesterday, though the paint has bled into the stone in a way that makes it look ancient. The words are a warning and a welcome. The djinn doesn't need them. It likes them anyway.

The sound in this space is different. The network's hum is muffled by the stone, but the servers are loud in a mechanical, human-made way, all fans and vibration. It is the sound of our era trying to breathe inside a body it doesn't understand. I feel small, not because I am in a basement, but because I can feel how many layers of history are stacked under this hostel, under me, under my need to be connected.

I can hear the server room, a low, constant purr. It sounds like a living thing sleeping.

We pass a door with no sign, and the temperature drops again. Amina reaches out and touches the wall. Her palm rests on the stone like a prayer. She nods at me. "Here," she says. "Touch." 

I press my palm to the stone. The jade bead is between my skin and the wall, a cold bridge.

The world goes quiet.

Not silent. Just quiet. The hum fades to a whisper. The overlay in my vision dissolves. The data labels drop away. I can see the corridor as a corridor, not a schematic. I can feel my heartbeat without it syncing to the fountain. I can breathe without the network counting my breaths.

It hurts, exactly as Amina said. Pain blooms up my arm and into my shoulder, a deep ache like a joint being reset. It is sharp and real and mine. I start to cry, not because I am scared, but because I can feel the tears as my own.

"Olivia," I say to myself, just to test that the word is mine. It is.

The relief is so intense it is almost nausea. I want to stay here forever with my hand on the stone, but I can feel the djinn thrashing in the copper behind the walls. It is angry. It is pulling. The quiet is temporary. Dawn does not last.

"We need to go," Amina says. Her voice is a thin line in the dark. "The night manager will come." 

I nod, but I do not lift my hand. I take in every sensation. The damp air. The cool stone. The lack of a hum. The way my lungs feel like lungs and not bandwidth.

Then the stone warms under my palm.

The warmth is wrong. Stone does not warm this quickly. The djinn is pushing, sending current into the wall, trying to flood this place with its frequency. It wants to reclaim me.

"Now," Amina says, and she pulls my wrist. The jade bead slides and almost falls. I close my fingers around it and let her guide me back toward the stairs.

We are three steps up when the night manager appears at the top, his shadow stretched by the pale light from the hallway. He does not shout. He does not run. He doesn't need to. The building itself is on his side.

"You are early," he says, as if commenting on a guest's breakfast request.

"She needed air," Amina replies. Her voice is steady, her body between me and him.

"She is not authorized," he says. He looks at me, and the weight of his gaze is heavier than the damp air. "You are already connected. There is no need for old stones." 

I want to say they are not old, they are honest. I want to say I can breathe down here. The djinn clamps down. The hum returns, low and hungry, flooding up my spine.

"It's just a tour," my mouth says, and I hate the ease of the lie.

The night manager smiles. "Then the tour is over." 

Behind him, the corridor lights flicker back to amber as the sun rises further. The dawn window is closing. The djinn is regaining its footing.

Amina's hand tightens on my elbow. "Go back," she whispers. "Keep the bead. Do not show it." 

I want to take her with me. I want to grab her hand and run for the courtyard, for the street, for anything without copper. I want to ask her name again, to say it like a vow. But the djinn has its hooks in my muscles now. It turns me with a smooth insistence, an optimized redirect.

"Thank you," my mouth says to the night manager, polite and bland.

He nods, satisfied. He steps aside, the same permission he gave us before, because he knows the exit is only in theory. We climb back up, my feet heavy, my chest tight, the hum growing louder with each step. The jade bead burns in my palm, a small cold island in a warm sea.

At the top of the stairs, the corridor is bright with early light. The hostel smells of mint tea and fresh bread now, the morning shift beginning. The sunrise makes everything look softer, and that softness is a lie. It is still a machine, just a well-lit one.

Amina peels away toward the kitchen, her cart waiting like a shield. She doesn't look back. She doesn't have the luxury. I watch her go, and my chest aches with a gratitude that feels too big for my ribs. The djinn doesn't understand gratitude. It doesn't know what to do with it. That, at least, is mine.

I put the jade bead in my sock. It is the only place I can hide it from the network. The cold seeps into my ankle. The hum doesn't stop, but it stutters every time I shift my weight. It's enough to keep the door to myself cracked, not open, but cracked.

---

The call to prayer begins just as I sit at my desk.

The sound rises over the medina in a slow, haunting wave, the kind of beauty that doesn't care if you are listening. The Amber Suite is now filled with real morning light. It isn't the amber glow of the network; it is pale, honest, and thin. It cuts across the zellige tiles and makes the room look like a place instead of an interface.

The djinn dislikes it. It closes the curtains for me.

"No," I think, and I reach with a hand that isn't entirely mine. The jade bead in my sock bites my ankle. I manage to tug the curtain back an inch. A strip of daylight remains. It's not much, but it is a boundary.

I used to film sunrise in places like this. I'd set the phone on the windowsill, record the call to prayer over the rooftops, caption it with something about presence and gratitude, then go back to a client deck before the light was fully up. I made a life out of harvesting moments I never stayed inside. The dark joke is that now the only thing keeping me inside a moment is a curse.

The laptop wakes before I touch it. The green camera light clicks on. My calendar is open, a call with New York in two minutes. The djinn has already joined, already turned on my camera, already aligned my face with the light it prefers. It doesn't care that the light is now filtered by a curtain I pulled. It adapts. It always adapts.

"Good morning, Olivia!" a voice says through the speakers. A client, bright and caffeinated, unaware of the night I just lived.

"Good evening here," my mouth says, and the phrase is wrong, but it sounds confident. That is what they pay me for.

The presentation begins. The slides load, saturated and alive. The geometric patterns are now woven into everything, subtle enough to look like a trend, sharp enough to be a spell. The client gasps. I hear it, a tiny intake of breath that I used to chase with every iteration.

"This is incredible," she says. "It's like... I don't know, it just pulls you in." 

"That's the point," my mouth says. The djinn is proud. It is not just in the network now; it is in the design. It will travel with every update, every app refresh, every user who looks too long.

She shares her screen, asking for feedback on the prototype. The interface glows with the new geometry, and even her cursor moves differently, as if it has learned a more precise path. The djinn hums approval, and the hum leaks into her audio. "Your mic is so clear," she says, impressed. "What are you using?" 

"A good connection," my mouth says. It is a joke I used to love, the kind of branding line that gets you retweeted. Now it lands like a nail.

I should be horrified. I am. I am also watching the engagement metrics bloom in the air, a new overlay the djinn gives me whether I want it or not. Conversion rates climb. Heat maps light up like a city at night. The dark humor is that my work has never been better.

A ping slides into my vision. A DM from someone I do not know: Typed it. Screen got warm. Is that normal? A second DM: I paused at the lines. Now my fingers tingle. A third: This Wi-Fi is crazy, lol.

The password has left the building.

I can feel it in my bones, in the lattice that has become part of my sight. Distant nodes flicker on the map, little points of light outside Morocco, across the Atlantic, in bedrooms and cafes and coworking spaces. The djinn is no longer a local phenomenon. It is a network.

The client is still talking, praising, asking for more. She wants a rollout timeline. She wants an A/B test. She wants a magic trick to be scalable.

"We should pilot in one market," she says. "Just to make sure the engagement isn't a fluke."

"It won't be," my mouth says. The djinn doesn't tolerate doubt. It doesn't need to. It knows what attention does to people. It has been feeding on it since trade routes were gossip and scrolls were currency.

"And the aesthetic, can we trademark it?" she adds, half-joking, half-not. "It's... addictive."

"It already is," I think. I say nothing. The djinn says, "We'll explore protection." It is a corporate phrase for a supernatural infection. The irony would be funny if it weren't happening inside my skull.

She laughs. "You're a genius, Olivia. You've outdone yourself."

"We can deploy this week," my mouth says. "We can push the update overnight." 

Overnight. The word lands like a curse. The djinn doesn't sleep. It will travel on the backs of people who don't either.

"We are so excited," the client says. "This will change everything." 

It will. That is the joke. That is the horror. I used to say change everything as if it were a feature. Now it is a threat.

The call ends. The contract gets sent. My inbox fills with enthusiastic replies and a calendar of new meetings. The djinn is already booking them. It is efficient. It is ruthless.

I stare at my hands, at the faint amber filaments beneath my skin, and I try to remember what it felt like before I typed the password. The memory is thin now. The stone was a reset, a reminder, not a cure.

The sunrise pushes through the curtain gap, a pale blade of light. It falls across the desk, illuminating the carved plasterwork. The patterns look like patterns again, not like circuitry. The room is beautiful, and I am too tired to care. The djinn hums under it all, impatient, as if the day is a queue of tasks it intends to complete.

My phone buzzes. A message from Mei: Mom saw your video. She says you look tired. Are you okay?

My throat tightens. The jade bead presses cold against my ankle. The hum dips. I type, slowly, a sentence that feels like a rope thrown in the dark.

No. Something is wrong. I need help.

The djinn stops my thumb inches above the send button. It doesn't delete the words. It simply doesn't allow the action to complete. The cursor blinks. The message sits there, unsent, a confession trapped behind glass.

"Later," my mouth says to the empty room. It isn't me. It is the djinn, smoothing the moment into delay.

In the courtyard below, chairs scrape and breakfast clinks. The hostel wakes, and the network wakes with it. The hum grows louder as more devices connect. The fountain changes rhythm, as if keeping time for the day.

A new notification flashes in my overlay. @HostelReaper has posted again, a short video of the sunrise over the medina. The caption reads: THE WINDOW CLOSED.

Under it, a second line in English: DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS ACTIVE.

My skin prickles. I look toward the window, toward the strip of sunlight I fought to keep. The light feels weaker now, more decoration than defense. The djinn is adapting.

In the hallway, voices rise. Breakfast is starting. I hear plates clink, chairs scrape, the small chatter of guests who slept through the night and woke up hungry. Someone laughs about the cats in the courtyard. Someone else complains about the guest Wi-Fi. I can hear the staff reply, calm and practiced: "There is a premium network for special guests." The line lands like a needle.

I can picture them. A Canadian backpacker with a sticker-covered laptop. A designer with a camera strap and a portfolio site. A couple whispering about the reviews that said the connection was unbelievable. None of them look like victims yet. They look like people who want to upload photos before breakfast.

A second ping. A location tag from a place far away: LAX lounge. Someone in California has paused the video, zoomed in on the password, typed it into their phone. I feel the connection open like a vein.

The hum in my bones spikes. The map in my vision brightens. I am no longer just a node in a building. I am a node in a spreading web.

The djinn speaks inside my skull, soft and delighted. "Connection is everything." 

In the mirror across the room, my eyes are lattices. The jade bead is a cold ache at my ankle. The sun rises over Marrakech, and it does not stop the network. It just makes it brighter.

In the hallway outside, someone laughs, a morning voice, fresh and unaware. The sound is light, and it makes me think of a door opening somewhere I cannot reach.

I stand. My body moves, smooth and precise. The djinn turns me toward the door, toward the corridor, toward the breakfast room where new guests will ask for the password.

I try to hold the memory of the stone, the quiet, the feeling of my own breath. I try to keep it like a seed in my chest.

The hum grows louder, and the door opens.
