My phone lights my thigh like a branding iron. The word UPDATE glows through the fabric, and for a stupid heartbeat I think the phone is bleeding.

I don't pull it out. I make myself stare at the tea seller's hands instead, the way he pours in a thin silver arc, wrist loose, elbow high. The tea is foamy and sweet and alive. The air is cumin and orange peel and grilled meat, and the city is a loud, breathing animal. If I can stay inside this noise, maybe the quiet hum can't find me.

Mackenzie watches me like I'm a live wire. Her eyes keep flicking to my pocket, as if she can see the glow, as if she can see the cursor blinking inside me. She reaches across the table and covers my pocket with her hand. The heat through the linen makes her jerk away.

"That's not normal," she says.

"Nothing is normal," I say. My voice comes out too sharp. I breathe. I soften it. "It's just a notification. It's just..." I don't have a word for what it is.

The tea seller smiles at us, unaware, and sets two glasses down. The foam at the rim trembles in perfect hexagons. My stomach dips. I see it everywhere now.

"Drink," Mackenzie says. "We're alive. Just drink the tea." She says it like a parent trying to get a kid to swallow cough syrup.

I lift the glass. It's hot. The mint hits my nose, sweet and sharp, and for a second the phone buzz fades under the scent. I sip. The sugar is almost violent. I can taste the copper in my own mouth, but maybe that's just my fillings. Maybe that's just my imagination. It's a relief to have a sensation that isn't electronic.

My pocket buzzes again. The cup rattles against my teeth. I set it down. A kid at the next table laughs into his phone. His screen shows a spinning wheel and the network name in Arabic, the same one that blinked at me when I first connected: انا اسمعك. I hear you.

"We have to move," I say.

"Where?" Mackenzie asks. Her voice is ragged. "It's everywhere." She looks around the square. There are phones on every table. Blue light in every face. The sound of notifications is a chorus. The city isn't a dead zone. It's a server rack.

I stand, the chair scraping the stones. A pulse of nausea rolls through me. I clutch the jade strip in my palm. It's warm now, too warm, like a stone left in the sun.

"We can find a dead zone," I say. "We can find someplace with no Wi-Fi. No electricity. A..." A cave? A desert? A monastery? The words feel stupid, like a wellness retreat pitch.

Mackenzie laughs once, short and humorless. "You mean a digital detox?" She wipes her forehead with the back of her wrist. "I left my phone in a plant." Her eyes dart to the glow in my pocket. "You didn't."

"I'm not using it," I say, which is technically true. The phone buzzes again, hotter now, and the fabric of my pants feels too thin.

"Turn it off," she says.

"It turned itself on before." I pull it out, because the heat is burning. The screen lights on its own. A prompt fills it: REAUTHENTICATE. Sixty-six empty characters wait like teeth. Under it, a soft amber button: ACCEPT.

My thumb hovers. The screen reflects my face, amber-tinted and smoothed. It looks like a filter called "grounded." The word ACCEPT seems to breathe.

"Airplane mode," Mackenzie says, as if it's a spell.

I swipe down. The airplane icon is gray. I tap it. It flashes, then fades. A small message appears: AIRPLANE MODE DISABLED BY ADMIN.

"Admin?" Mackenzie says.

"Apparently I'm a managed device now," I say. A laugh starts in my chest and doesn't make it out.

A man on a scooter stops near our table, his phone mounted to the handlebar. The GPS display glows with a geometric pattern instead of a map. He frowns, taps it, and the pattern spins faster. He looks up and meets my eyes. For a second I see recognition on his face, and then he shakes his head and drives off. The scooter's tail light leaves an amber streak.

"We go," I say. I stand, leaving the tea untouched. The tea seller calls after me, but I don't look back.

We thread through the medina. The alleys are narrow and alive with motion, the smell of leather and spice and exhaust. The call to prayer rolls over the rooftops, the muezzin's voice stretching like a cable. I want to sink into it, to let it be the only frequency in my skull.

Mackenzie walks close, shoulder to shoulder, the way you do when you don't want to be separated. I keep the phone in my hand now. If it's going to burn me, I want to see the flame.

"Maybe we can find a place without phones," she says. "Like a hammam." She says it like she's remembering a blog post. She glances at me. "They don't let you bring anything in. It's all steam and buckets." Her voice is hopeful and tired.

A hammam. Steam and scrub and no electronics. It sounds like a ritual cleansing, and I can almost hear Amina telling me to breathe.

"Okay," I say. "We find a hammam. We get scrubbed. We... detox." I hear myself and almost laugh. A self-help arc in a horror story.

We ask directions from a man selling slippers. He points us down a lane that smells like charcoal. "Hammam in ten minutes," he says. He eyes my phone. "Put it away," he adds, in English. His eyes are kind, but the words land like an order.

We keep walking.

The hum in my skull doesn't fade, but it shifts under the noise. The city is a web of electricity. The phone pings every few minutes, and each ping is a tug on my nerves. I keep my thumb off the screen. I keep moving.

We find the hammam down a narrow alley lit by a single red bulb. The door is half open, and warm, wet air spills out, carrying the smell of black soap and eucalyptus. A woman at the desk takes our money and hands us rough cloths. She points at my phone. "No," she says, and taps a sign that shows a phone with a red line through it.

"It stays," I say. My voice is too eager. I put it in a small locker, the metal cold against my fingers, and close the door. The phone buzzes once, long and angry, and then the locker muffles it.

Mackenzie does the same with her bracelet-wrapped phone, the one she dug out of the plant later because she couldn't leave it. We look at each other over the row of lockers. For a second, we are just two women in towels, hair damp, stripped of devices. It feels obscene and holy at the same time.

"If it opens itself," Mackenzie says.

"Then we stay in here forever," I say, and the dark humor lands somewhere between us like a coin.

The hammam is all tile and steam. The light is soft and yellow, filtered through a lattice in the ceiling. Women move through the fog in slow arcs, skin slick with soap, bodies anonymous. The air is thick enough to drink.

The first room is warm. The second is hotter. The third is a furnace. We sit on the heated stone, letting the heat pull sweat from our skin. The warmth is physical, not electronic, and I can feel my body for the first time in days. My muscles loosen. My breathing slows.

"This is good," Mackenzie whispers. Her eyes are closed. "This is... real." She laughs, and it echoes off the tile.

A woman with strong arms pours water over us. The water is scalding, then cold. She rubs black soap into my skin, thick and slick. The scent is olive and smoke. It feels like being erased. She scrubs with a rough mitten, and rolls of skin peel away. It's gross and satisfying. I watch my old skin gather on the tile like gray eraser shavings.

For a minute, I am only a body. A body in heat and steam. No metrics. No engagement. No updates.

Then I notice the tile patterns.

The walls are covered in small blue and white zellige, the kind I've seen everywhere in this city. But the pattern here is different. It spirals, it converges. It looks like a network map. In the steam, the lines seem to move.

I blink. The pattern holds. The hum in my skull rises. The water bucket beside me shivers, not from my hand but from something beneath the stone.

"Do you hear that?" I whisper.

Mackenzie opens her eyes. "Hear what?"

I focus. Under the hiss of steam and the slap of water, there is a faint tone, the same sub-audible frequency that lives in the hostel walls. It shouldn't be here. There are no routers in a hammam, no screens, no devices. The room is old, older than the hostel, older than the network.

A woman across the room laughs, and for a second her laugh is two notes at once, a harmonic overlay. She looks at me and smiles. Her eyes are clear. The smile is normal. But the sound lingers.

I feel the jade strip against my palm. It's damp and hot. I curl my fingers around it. The stone is a pulse.

"We should go," I say.

"We just got here," Mackenzie says. "We should stay. My shoulders are finally unclenching." She rubs her neck, wincing, then sighs. "Maybe it's just you. Maybe it's..." She shrugs. "Maybe it's in your head."

"It is in my head," I say. I laugh, but it's thin. "That's the problem." I stand, and the heat makes me dizzy. The floor tilts.

A woman with a shaved head walks past, carrying a bucket. She hums under her breath, a melody that rises and falls like a signal. She pauses by the fountain in the corner and pours water in a precise rhythm: six splashes, a pause, six splashes. My stomach drops.

"Do you see that?" I say.

Mackenzie turns. The woman is gone, or maybe she never was. The fountain water settles into a normal drip. The pattern on the tiles looks static. The hum fades into the steam.

I am losing my mind. Or the network is good at gaslighting.

We finish the scrub in a haze. The attendant pours buckets over us, and the water makes my skin feel new and raw. I want to be grateful. Instead I'm afraid of what the network might do to this new skin.

We wrap ourselves in towels and sit in the cool room to dry. The air there is crisp and smells like orange blossom. Mackenzie leans her head back against the wall and closes her eyes. I watch the door to the lockers.

"If we get our phones," she says, "we can leave this city. We can go somewhere rural. A desert. A mountain." Her voice is weak with hope.

"If it follows power lines," I say, "then the desert is just a long cable." I rub my wet hair between my hands. The water feels like data slipping through my fingers.

She looks at me. "You're giving up," she says.

"I'm being realistic." The words taste like old coffee. I can't tell if I'm protecting us or surrendering.

We go to the lockers. My phone is cold now, dead-looking. I open the door and lift it out. The screen is black. For a second, relief floods me.

Then the screen turns on. The same prompt. The same amber button. The same cursor blinking, patient as a pulse. A new line of small text sits beneath it: LOCATION AUTHENTICATED.

I bite the inside of my cheek until I taste blood. "It knows where we are," I whisper.

"It's a phone," Mackenzie says, but her voice is thin.

"It's a net," I say.

We dress in silence. Outside, the air is cooler. The alley smells like wet stone and fried dough. For a moment, the night feels normal. The hum is still there, but the city masks it.

We walk without speaking, weaving through the maze. The medina is a map of repeating patterns, every turn like the last. I try to keep track, but the alleyways fold. The network doesn't need me to be lost. It needs me to be tired.

"We need a plan," Mackenzie says.

"We need Amina," I say, and the name is a knot in my throat. She has my laptop. She has my bag. She has risked something to help me. If the network finds her because of me, I don't know if I can carry that.

"She told us to go when the city sleeps," Mackenzie says. "Maybe she has a place. Maybe she knows a route." She looks at my face. "We should get back to her."

"Back to the hostel," I say.

We stop in the middle of the street. The idea hangs between us like a bad joke. The hostel is a trap. The hostel is where the network is strongest. The hostel is where my laptop is typing without me. The hostel is where the staff are waiting.

"Maybe she left," Mackenzie says.

"Maybe she can't," I say. I picture Amina in the linen closet, trying to hide my bag while the walls hum. The image makes my stomach churn.

"We could call her," Mackenzie says.

"We can't call anyone," I say, and lift my phone. The prompt glows back at me. Accept. Accept. Accept.

We walk again, slower now. The city around us blurs. We pass a storefront with a television in the window, showing a soccer match. The crowd on the screen moves in perfect synchronization, a wave of bodies. For a second, their faces flicker into geometric patterns. I blink. It's just a TV. It's just my brain.

A group of teenagers pass, laughing, phones in hand. One of them is scrolling through Instagram. My name appears on his screen for a second, a story thumbnail with my face. The circle around it glows amber. He doesn't know me. He just taps, because that's what thumbs do. My heart thuds. The network is already posting. It doesn't need me to be home to use my voice.

I grab his arm without thinking. "Where did you get that?" I say, too fast, too intense.

He jerks back, eyes wide. "What?" He pulls his phone away.

"Show me," I say. My tone is wrong. My face is too intense. He looks at his friends, then at me, then at Mackenzie, and decides I'm a crazy tourist. He laughs nervously and walks away.

"Olivia," Mackenzie says, low. "Let it go.

"That's me," I say. "That's my face. I didn't post that." I open my own app, and the prompt fills the screen again, overwriting the feed. REAUTHENTICATE.

"It won't let you in," she says.

"It's posting without me," I say. The words feel like a betrayal. The network doesn't just want me; it wants my identity, my distribution channels. It's already using me as a mouth, even while I'm walking through this maze in a damp shirt.

We stop under a hanging lightbulb that hums. The bulb flickers in rhythm with the prompt on my screen. For a second, I want to throw the phone into the street. The desire is clean and violent.

"Do it," Mackenzie says.

I raise my arm. The phone is light and heavy all at once. My hand trembles. I imagine the data in it: my contacts, my photos, my last voice memo from my dad. I imagine all the work files, the half-written captions. The life I curated, the proof.

"I can't," I say. My arm drops.

"You can," she says, but her voice cracks, and I know she can't either.

We keep walking.

The streets shift. We end up near Jemaa el-Fnaa, the big square, now a chaos of drums, smoke, monkeys on chains, and tourists with their phones raised like offerings. The noise is overwhelming. It's easy to be anonymous here. It's also easy to be swallowed.

I spot a man with a sign in English: OFFLINE DETOX. NO WIFI. NO PHONES. He sits cross-legged next to a stack of books and a bowl of herbs. The sign is printed in a clean sans-serif font. The irony is perfect.

"Is this a joke?" Mackenzie says.

The man looks up and smiles. "Not a joke," he says. "You are tired of noise, yes?" His English is careful. "Come, sit. Ten minutes without screens. You will feel new."

"Do you have electricity?" I ask.

He laughs. "City has electricity. I have tea. I have books. I have herbs." He gestures to the bowl. Dried leaves. Sage? Maybe. He gestures to his sign. "No Wi-Fi. Only air."

My phone buzzes. The word AIR flashes on the screen, as if mocking him.

I look at Mackenzie. She shrugs. "Ten minutes?" she says. "We're already here."

We sit on low cushions. The man pours us tea from a dented metal pot. The tea smells like mint and smoke. He takes a handful of herbs and burns them in a small clay burner. The smoke curls, thick and pungent. The scent is sharp, almost medicinal. It reminds me of Amina's pouch.

"This is for cleansing," he says. "For djinn." He says the word with casual respect, not fear.

I feel my skin prickle. "Do you believe in them?" I ask.

He lifts his shoulders. "Belief doesn't change what is," he says. He looks at my phone. "You are already in their web.

I flinch. "How do you know?"

He smiles. "We all are. But some are more tangled." He waves the smoke toward me. It stings my eyes. "Breathe.

I inhale. The smoke is harsh. It scratches my throat. It smells like burnt mint and something ancient. The hum in my skull drops a notch, or maybe it's my imagination. The phone buzzes again, and the smoke seems to interrupt it, the vibration stuttering.

"Turn it off," he says.

"It won't," I say.

"Give it to me," he says. His hand is out, palm up. It's steady.

I hesitate. The phone is a weight. The phone is a chain. The phone is my only contact, my only proof, my only link to the life I built. It's also a portal. I know this. I still hesitate.

Mackenzie looks at me. Her eyes are red from steam and fear. "Olivia," she says.

I place the phone in his hand. The moment it leaves my palm, my body feels lighter, like dropping a heavy bag. He turns it over, looks at the prompt, and makes a sound like a soft click of the tongue.

"It wants your mouth," he says.

He places the phone in the bowl of herbs. The screen goes black for a heartbeat, then flares bright. The prompt shifts. The word ACCEPT elongates, the letters curling like smoke. He doesn't flinch.

"Say nothing," he says.

"It's just a phone," Mackenzie says, but her voice is uncertain.

"Phones are small mirrors," he says. "If you talk into them, something talks back."

The smoke thickens. The phone vibrates, a long, angry buzz. The man raises the bowl and turns it, letting the smoke roll over the screen. The smell is strong enough to make my eyes water. I cough. The phone's vibration slows, then stops.

Silence blooms. It's small, but it's there.

"It's off," Mackenzie whispers.

"For now," he says. He hands it back to me. The screen is dark. The glass is warm. My hand trembles, but I take it.

"You should leave the city," he says. "This place is full of currents. Djinn like currents." He looks at the smoke and shakes his head. "But you cannot leave the way you came. It will follow your steps. You must confuse it. You must cut the thread."

"How?" I ask.

He shrugs. "Sometimes you cut. Sometimes you burn. Sometimes you pray. Sometimes you run until it doesn't want you anymore." He nods at the jade in my hand. "You have protection already. But you also have hunger. That is harder.

The last word lands hard. Hunger. That's what it is. Not the network. Not the djinn. Me. The part of me that wants to check, to post, to optimize. The part that gets fed by a red circle around my profile picture.

"Thank you," I say. It feels inadequate.

We stand. The noise of the square rushes back in. The silence was a thin bubble. It pops.

"Do we trust him?" Mackenzie asks as we walk away.

"We trusted the hostel," I say. The dark humor is a bruise.

The phone stays dark as we move. I grip it like a stone. My thumb keeps wanting to wake it, like a tongue poking a sore tooth. I don't. I count steps instead. I count the fountain beats in my head. Six, pause, six.

We take a different route, weaving through alleys that smell like fried fish and cedar. The city seems to fold, like a map being closed. The hum is quieter, maybe because of the smoke, maybe because of the crowds. I don't trust it.

"We should go back for Amina," Mackenzie says. "If she helped us, she might need help.

"She told us to wait," I say. But I can't stop picturing her, alone in that linen closet. The image is a hook.

We stop in a narrow lane where the walls are close enough to touch with both hands. My phone is still dark. The jade is warm. The city breathes.

"We can go back," I say. "We can get Amina. We can leave together. Maybe she knows a place to go."

"And if the hostel is watching?" Mackenzie says.

"It's watching regardless," I say. "At least if we go back, we're not leaving her.

We turn toward the hostel.

The decision is a hard turn in my chest. It feels like stepping toward a camera with the lens cap off. Every part of me that learned to perform for a screen wants to smooth my hair, lift my chin, look presentable. I hate that part. I obey it anyway.

The closer we get, the louder the hum becomes. The city's noise thins, and the hostel's frequency rises like a tide. By the time we reach the lane outside the riad, my phone is warm again.

We stop a half-block away. The hostel's façade glows soft amber, the carved plasterwork catching the streetlight like circuitry. The front door is open. A stream of guests goes in and out, laughing, dragging their rolling bags. The staff move in the doorway like figures in a well-designed animation.

"Maybe we wait," Mackenzie whispers. "Maybe we go later.

"It is later," I say. The sky above the rooftops is ink. The city sleeps in patches.

My phone buzzes once, then lights. The prompt is back. REAUTHENTICATE. The amber button pulses, matching the fountain rhythm I can hear through the walls.

I look at the screen, then at the open door. I think of Amina in the linen closet. I think of my laptop, alone, typing without hands. I think of my followers, watching a story I didn't post. I think of the boy in the square tapping my face.

"We just need to get her," I say. I don't know who I'm convincing.

Mackenzie swallows. "In and out," she says. "We don't go to the cafe. We don't go upstairs.

"We don't go upstairs," I echo, and feel a lie slide through my mouth.

We move toward the door, the hum building like a chorus. The air is warm, too warm, and smells faintly of ozone. The carved patterns on the walls seem to shift as we pass, like something waking up.

The front door is a dark mouth. The light inside is amber and inviting. I step across the threshold, and the phone in my hand vibrates in a long, satisfied buzz.

Behind me, the city noise drops away. In front of me, the fountain beats.

The cursor in my head blinks.
